## First Thing

- 10:14: BOT GE, R
- 10:14: adjusted stops, kept fingers crossed.
- overnight, SX7P was stopped out
- 10:38: feeling bearish, shorted MXEA, R and NIY. 
- 10:39: decided that US short term rates are going even lower: bought GE.
- 11:18: got cold feet and closed my UB short. Equities look as though they are going lower, and UB will kneejerk up.
- 11:47: MIB closed via limit order. Things are looking up. Realized $10K

- 14:02: got short ES. Both this and R got stopped out.
- 14:02: showing good profits (4%) on general weakness. Also closed positions have lowered margin to 305K
- 14:03: debt still holding up pretty well, gold not showing any strength. Miners weak. RUT position (-$400K) big contributor to profits.

- 16:07: Bought to open: TSLA Sept 18'20 200 PUT, RUT Oct15'20 900 put, 
- 16:09: Sold to close: NFLX Nov20'20 220 put, UBER June 19'20 21 Put, MGM Mar27'20 16.5 put

- 16:12:  Sold to close: BA mAY 15'20 240 PUT

- 16:12: Bought to close: HYG Apr17'20 87 CALL

All the above via limit orders (I think!).
