## First Thing

- 10:14: BOT GE, R
- 10:14: adjusted stops, kept fingers crossed.
- overnight, SX7P was stopped out
- 10:38: feeling bearish, shorted MXEA, R and NIY. 
- 10:39: decided that US short term rates are going even lower: bought GE.
- 11:18: got cold feet and closed my UB short. Equities look as though they are going lower, and UB will kneejerk up.
- 11:47: MIB closed via limit order. Things are looking up. Realized $10K
