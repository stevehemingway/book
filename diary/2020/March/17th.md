Starting to be fearful of any continued (short) equity exposure. Markets have gone down 30+%. At some point they will bounce. Still short, and with loose stops because intra day fluctuations are large. 
Covid-19 is a severe headwind for the global economy.
The big worry now is that markets will be closed and the authorities will bring out the fiscal bazookas (or howitzers) just at a time where I am locked into unfavourable positions.

In recognition of the risks of fiscal action, I started to short some govvies. GBL and R. Not large positions.

As of 10:35 equities are down:

- DJ600 BY 2.5%
- es 0.75%
- FTMIB by 5.66%
- HSI by 2.4%
- RDXUSD by 4.3%
- SX7P by 3.5%
- TOPX by 1.7%

(Actually, these were noted a while ago. There has been a bit of a bounce in the last half hour which cut your gains in half. 
Currently, you are up 0.8%: effectively a rounding error in today's stormy weather.)

Decided to put on a number of stop and limit orders to scale back risk in the face of further volatility. Generally, the futures had stop orders, the larger option positions had limit orders. Generally, the limit orders will show a healthy profit. The stops should contain the positions to modest losses. These were all trailing stops, so if the positions make further profits, these should be locked in.
