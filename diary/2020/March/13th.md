## Summary

Got a bit carried away with profits yesterday and decided to increase exposure at time of maximum panic. 
The authorities are promising stimulus packages today.
Yesterday central banks underwhelmed, particularly Lagarde, who is out of ammunition,
and generally disliked by most people, I think it's fair to say.

Result was a lurch down as most markets rocketed. FTMIB up 14%. Must be an all time record.

For the record, and sounding like a broken record, I am still bearish.
