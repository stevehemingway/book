Early indications (Twitter) suggested that equity markets were going to open down, so you sold ESTX50 & NQ. UB was hit hard, and you sold an extra lot. UB is very long duration and very volatile, so it's uncomfortable. You sold BTP too, which seems a 'safe' bet (haha!).

TWS warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: DJ600, FTMIB, NQ, RDXUSD.

Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing GBL and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe GBL is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the UK has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. TBH, I'm grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up somewhere.
