# Monday 16th March	

Emergency rate cut by the Fed again, 50bp, down to 25bp. Smells of desperation.

Lost some money on UB but panned out.

Trades:

> ESTX50, FTMIB, N225, K200, Z

All sales, all futures. 

Options markets now getting very illiquid. No quotes in OOM puts in most things including SX7P, the Euro banks index.
