## Monday 9th

Chaos overnight: Saudi declared war on Russia and pushed crude prices down to $32

- 00:03: sold some more softbank (9434)
- 01:49: Somehow bought 4 AUD. Think this was a left-over stop. Anyway, made money on it!
- 06:17: sold Mar Z. 
- 06:33: bot GC (chaos, not inflation)
- 08:03: 21 Mar 3000 puts on ESTX50 sold at 155.30 and bought back (stop) at 181.90 40 mins later (ugh!)
- 08:46: Sold 1 MXEA Mar
- 09:04: sold 3 SX7P Mar
- 09:06: sold 1 TOPX Mar
- 10:22: bought 1 EUR Mar

Overall, had instinctive feeling that today was going down. Racheted up my exposure to $327.9K margin. Scary!

Mondays are odd, because the US markets don't get going until the US morning, so there are no live prices for ES in the morning. Your exposure to the far east via US derivatives (FXI puts) is considerable. This is likely to be a huge day for you. The question now is how to avoid getting crushed by the bounce. You have to unwind, but what do you trade??
