about &pound;0.23M made today. Short euro long-dated govt. bonds did most of the heavy lifting.

Dollar continues to be strong. Shorted some EM currencies - BRE, MXN.

Closed GBP position. No loss. Hurray.

Opened up long FTSE/short SP500. Equal cash exposures.

Continued dollar strength and T-bond weakness have delivered further gains today.

C benefits from this too, although your 'personal' account is close to margin limits so you cannot extend your exposure more.

Equity markets are going up, but there is no divergence between the UK and US, so the hedged equity strategy is flat overall.

European bonds are down a bit, but nothing compared to T-bonds. Italy has still got a long way to go. Hopefully, the new election will produce  decisive result.

Gilts are down a bit, the pound continues to weaken.
