about &pound;0.23M made today. Short euro long-dated govt. bonds did most of the heavy lifting.

Dollar continues to be strong. Shorted some EM currencies - BRE, MXN.

Closed GBP position. No loss. Hurray.

Opened up long FTSE/short SP500. Equal cash exposures.

Continued dollar strength and T-bond weakness have delivered further gains today.

C benefits from this too, although your 'personal' account is close to margin limits so you cannot extend your exposure more.

Equity markets are going up, but there is no divergence between the UK and US, so the hedged equity strategy is flat overall.

European bonds are down a bit, but nothing compared to T-bonds. Italy has still got a long way to go. Hopefully, the new election will produce  decisive result.

Gilts are down a bit, the pound continues to weaken.

Finally ZB and UB as well as most other bonds snapped back. Equities continued to climb, rather inconsistently. The hedging of Z against ES worked well: so well that I made no money. 

BTP did well, moving against GBL. I am not quite sure about Italy. There is a panic on about emerging market bonds, and Italy may have become infected. 

BRE, MXN and CLP all did well, suggesting that EM countries are coming back from the brink. The big story is Argentina, which has had a poor showing for its currency (short term interest rates up to 40%), although this seems to have stablized.

Things stabilized.  Low inflation reading pushed bonds and equities higher. The pound sagged a bit. Intraday volatility has been high lately,so I have no idea how today's P&L will look.
