# February 2016

== Armageddon out of here

February started with continued, strong headwinds. Not only were stocks battered, but my supposedly hedged interest rate strategy was coming apart.

The 'Japanification theory of Europe' started to get a hold, and Bunds seemed to go up remorelessly, in spite of record low yields. Eventually I capitulated and unwound the position.

The rag bag of short and long US stock positions were largely unwound too. Partly I liquidated the shorts too early, so that the falls on the longs eliminated all the profits taken on the shorts.

As of the second week of Feb, the markets have bounced off their lows, and I'm trying to be disciplined, and not get suckered into trying to surf the wave.
