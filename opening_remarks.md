# About this book

I believe that asset managers are like milkmen. A few rich people pay them a lot to deliver a product that is expensive and which can be obtained much more easily by dealing with a 

Many studies have shown that a chimp with a dartboard can construct a portfolio which outperforms the average  the average fund manager. If you pay the chimp in bananas he'll virtually always outperform, after fees. Nevertheless, most ordinary savers choose to hand over their savings to a professional. This book is an attempt to allow you to make an informed decision about whether to accept the advice of your financial advisor at face value.

The key to a DIY approach to investing is an understanding of risk. There are two aspects of this. Minimising risk for a given return, and deciding on the correct tradeoff between risk and return for your own preferences. Saving is about trading current consumption for future consumption. Each of us has values our current consumption relative to our future consumption differently. Conventional economic theory argues that utility is derived only from consumption, but I actually think that we get utility from knowing that we have assets 'for a rainy day', i.e. current utility, as well as the utility we receive when we actually consume those assets, but I am straying into a territory where I have no expertise.

I will spend a lot of time talking about risk. Risk is one of those things that is difficult to quantify. We want to take less risk, but we don't want to do so at the cost of locking ourselves into permanently low returns. Although we 
I think this is because most people do not know how to set about the business of 
investing their savings. 
You probably think that you could probably do pretty well, but you are worried that there
is a small but possibly significant risk that you'll mess things up horribly,
and this is simply not a risk you want to take with the money that you need to support you 
in retirement.

I therefore put a lot of emphasis on risk. What it means, how to measure it, 
how it depends on the composition of a portfolio, how to invest in derivatives
without taking unacceptable risks, and how to reduce risk 
by buying options. Most of all, I explain what the drivers of portfolio risk are, and
how risk and return are inextricably  linked.

A lot of books about modern portfolio theory are very ... theoretical. They are full of probability distributions, efficient frontiers, correlations and covariances. I am going to steer well clear of this stuff. Stephen Hawkin once wrote that every equation in a book cuts its potential readship by half. I cannot afford more than a couple of equations before my potential readship shrinks just to my mother, so be reassured that I will avoid equations, or at least use them purely for decoration.


This book is written with the aim of allowing the do-it-yourself investor to compete on at least level terms with the professional. I am however  keenly aware that most people will still prefer to leave it to a professional manager. In these cases, this book will allow a customer to make a fully informed choice of provider. There are many good financial advisors, and many know a great deal about investment. But they can face conflicts of interest, which can, in rare cases, lead to them giving less-than-optimal financial advice. Such investors are urged to read Chapter [XXX] carefully, and have the option of skipping Chapter [yyy].


## About me

I have worked in finance most of my life, and have been an active investor for the past couple of decades. 
I have made plenty of mistakes, and have learned from them. 
Although experience is (still) the best teacher, my goal is to make this book come a close second.

I want to write the book that I wish I had read when I started seriously investing in the mid 1990s.

## Collaboration
Apart from finance, one of my passionate interests is technology. 
Recently a number of good, free ('as in beer') utilities have been developed to make collaborative writing much less painful than it once was. Several of them use the magnificent tool called Git. This is not the place to talk about Git. But it is wonderful.

## Acknowledgements

I was first introduced to a economic and mathematical approach to securities and derivatives markets by Paul Roth, whom I met at Psion. I remain eternally grateful for that introduction.

I am also grateful for Tim Fletcher, formerly of Natwest Capital Markets, who opened my eyes to the pricing of interest rate swaps and other fixed income derivatives.

I've worked with lots of quants and programmers and traders over the years. I'm too lazy to list them all here, but I am grateful for the insights they imparted to me.

Many authors have helped me to the limited level of understanding that I've reached. Some are listed in the bibliography.

where I was working as a humble programmer. He had come to the company with the idea of developing a trading simulator. The idea was that pilots were starting to learn how to fly aeroplanes by using a flying simulator, 
because the cost of crashing a plane was so high, compared to the benefit of learning the controls.
The idea was that using a simulator was cheap, compared to crashing the bank. 
We never really did get the sales we were hoping for, but the simulator worked, after a fashion, and the experience of getting it to work hooked me on trying understand the magic of markets for the rest of my career.
