# All Weather Portfolios

The general idea of this is that timing the market is a mugs game, and that by choosing the appropriate mixture of asset types a portfolio can be constructed to withstand all types of 'weather'.  
The earliest idea was a mixture of domestic stocks and bonds \(often in a 60:40 mix\), but as other asset types have become more investable, this has been extended with new ingredients: TIPs, overseas equities, high yield bonds, commodities etc.

My own view is that at some point the long bull market in bonds is going to unravel and we are going to see a pickup of inflation that will progressively destroy bond returns. I believe that it is very important to remain calm in the face of losses, and resist the siren song to keep the faith in your original investment decisions.

## 60:40 Portfolio

60% stocks, 40% bonds. Stocks give growth, bonds reduce overall variance and produce income.

* 5 percent U.S. REITs

* 5 percent U.S. small cap value

* 15 percent Pacific equities

* 15 percent European equities

* 10 percent U.S. TIPs

* 10 percent U.S. high yield corp bonds

* 20 percent U.S. total bond

The advantage of this sort of portfolio is that does not require any rebalancing.

## Commodity Futures ETFs

These are ETFs that give investors an exposure to commodities without having to trade directly in the futures. Brokerages are reluctant, quite properly, to allow inexperienced investors to trade in futures because of the very high gearing that is possible using them. The ETFs have few assets under management by the standards of SPY and the big index-tracking funds. The strategies vary widely between funds, and are not at all transparent. The fees are high. The historical performance is poor. The sector is not popular, for these reasons.
