# Read Me

This is my attempt to write a book on investing. It is very far from being finished. I am doing this at least in part to understand gitbook and markdown and git. Currently, I've decided mainly to make a few notes about my trading activity in the hope that in the fullness of time something resembling a coherent strategy will emerge from it retrospectively.

I have had this project on the go for a number of years. I have dialled back my ambition for it and am currently only updating the trading diary section. If you are looking at this book on GitHub you'll see where the recent changes have happened.

If anyone wishes to contribute, especially by doing a bit of editing, I'd love to hear from him.
This started out as being compatible with Gitbook, but that project seems to have gone into abeyance. There seems to be someone willing to pick it up, but I don't have enough material yet so I'm not focussing on the production side at all.

I was thinking that it might work as a Jekyll website, but I don't want to think about this yet.

## Visitors

I see that I'm getting a few visitors to sites hosting my 'book'. I have no idea why this should be. Maybe like so much traffic on the internet these days, these aren't flesh and blood visitors, but just bots. Maybe some day these bots will have enough intelligence to enjoy my musings. Maybe some day after that they'll consider it unbearably simplistic.

## What this book is written in

I have decided to move back towards Markdown and also to re-focus the message of the book so it is more of a toolkit for investing action. I originally used the Gitbook default, which is Markdown, then I moved to Asciidoc, which seemed to offer a bit more, then I went back to Markdown, because, well, it's everywhere, and its supported everywhere. I think I'm probably using 'Git Flavored Markdown', but for this work it probably doesn't make any difference.

## The General Idea

This book is to tell you about how to take control of your savings. It is my attempt to record my successes, and failures as a private investor. It is a work in progress. If I have successes, may they inspire you. If I have failures, may some good come of them, as a guide how to avoid mistakes.

I do not claim to be a great expert on investing. However:

* I have been doing this for my own savings for a long time, and I felt that I'd learned some valuable lessons that I should share.

* I do do not want your money, unlike many of those who would offer you investment advice.

* Software really is eating the world, and nowhere more than in the finance industry. Tools that could be afforded only by traders in the biggest banks can now be used at no or nominal cost by private investors. There are even fewer reasons now to use a professional asset manager than there ever were in the past.

This book will  turn you into the next George Soros or John Paulson. It will not equip you to be convince anyone to fund your new hedge fund startup.  However, it should allow you to manage your own investments with confidence. Your performance should be good enough to outperform the  majority of fund managers. You will need to factor the extra time you spend researching, but you can offset this against your brokerage fees.

Remote repos now on GitHub and Bitbucket. I even set up a webhook for my Discord server. W00t.
