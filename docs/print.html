                        <h1><a class="header" href="#preface" id="preface">Preface</a></h1>
<p>I started writing this in 2016. I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect software to write it in. I tend to indulge in displacement activities. 
I chose <a href="https://gitbook.com">gitbook</a> initially, as it allows me to create in markdown and create content offline but sync to git so I can work on the source from any of my many machines (in an OS-independent way). I finally worked out how to make this show up in github pages (<a href="https://stevehemingway.github.io/book/">here</a>). The key files are <a href="/book.toml">/book.toml</a> and running 'mdbook build' on the command line. 
I don't know why, but I find the Github pages documentation fantastically confusing.</p>
<p>My main activity at the moment is giving a semi-running commentary on my investing. I am not sure that this will make very interesting reading, but it at least gives me some kind of narrative which I can use for investing.</p>
<p>I want to avoid this being just a book listing every possible type of security. Hopefully, I the various options will arise naturally as I explain my various trading ideas.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#intro" id="intro">Intro</a></h1>
<p>You have to have a reasonable amount of capital to make it worth reading this book, if you measure the benefits in purely financial terms. If you have only a hundred pounds to invest, the extra return you make is simply not going to cover the opportunity cost of reading this book, let alone the cost of buying it. However, you never know when you might come into money, and you can at least sound financially well-informed to your friends, even if you are broke.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-invest" id="why-invest">Why Invest?</a></h2>
<p>We all consume resources and nearly all of us produce resources. 
footnote:[Global savings equals global investment as an identity, in the sense that all production not for immediate consumption must be financed by somebody's saving, somewhere. This of course includes accumulation of inventories.]
The timings of our consumption and production may not synchronize well, which leads us to save, and sometimes to borrow, to allow our pattern of consumption to be better timed.
We may wish to consume more education or durable goods early in our lives, to enjoy benefits later.
We may wish to save some of what we produce in our prime for our old age.
We may wish to save for some specific future event: having children, going on holiday, buying a house.</p>
<p>All these give rise to different time horizons for our savings, and to different tolerances for risk.
Quantifying risk is a big subject in the context of investment: possibly the biggest of all, and I shall come back to it. This book focusses mainly on savings over the longer term, by which I mean around ten years or longer. Sometimes a short term requirement for funds can be met by borrowing, but for most individuals there is a big spread between the rate at which they can borrow, and the rate at which they can lend, which means that it's rarely possible to substitute borrowing for liquidation of an investment.</p>
<p>From a strict economic perspective, consumption is what matters, but I think that it's possible to derive a considerable benefit from having savings that are big enough to cover the cost of any 'rainy day' that fortune may throw at us. 
On the other hand, there is no point in saving so much out of one's income that life is a miserable struggle.</p>
<p>Finally, try to avoid being both a saver and a borrower at the same time. Although this is hard to avoid entirely, this is usually a bad choice because of the asymmetrical behaviour of the tax system (often you will pay tax in the returns from saving, but not save tax on the cost of borrowing). Also, the 'spread' between saving and borrowing rates usually means that it is very hard to beat the return you get by reducing your borrowing.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#for-the-technically-minded" id="for-the-technically-minded">For the technically minded</a></h2>
<p>The files for this book are kept as git repositories on gitbook, github and bitbucket. You can fork my source from the first two. I will probably delete from one fairly soon. Gitbook is a git server, so the easiest way to edit offline is to edit, git add, git commit and git push to gitbook. There are lots of links to gitbook attached to this book. Follow them if you are interested.</p>
<p>I started using markdown, then went to asciidoc. Unfortunately, asciidoc is just not as well supported, so I reverted to markdown, which wasted a bit of time. Markdown is pretty basic, but it's fairly intuitive, and lots of platforms and tools use it. Many editors have syntax colouring for it. I strongly recommend Typora as a markdown editor. It does a lot more than simply allow one to create stuff in markdown and covert it to HTML.</p>
<p>I've used latex format for the odd equation, and embedded them with katex. This is black magic to me, but it seems to work. The maths is not important. I just put it in to keep the nerds happy.</p>

<p>All the press is discussing the fact that the settlment price for April WTI was negative $37! Seems amazing, but of course when there is no storage, you may have to pay for the privilege of delivering to someone.</p>
<p>As always, a green print on your portfolio value always emboldens you to trade. This mornings trades were:</p>
<ul>
<li>trimmed back GC, still a bit long gold.</li>
<li>sold an ES call. Still a bit long, but equity indexes falling back,</li>
<li>bought NG, couple of lots</li>
<li>sold CL, one lot, to get exposure to the crude/gas spread. </li>
<li>sold WEIR -- an overhyped and expensive stock highly exposed to the fracking business.</li>
<li>bought some European EURN, bought some FRO (put in an order). These trades seem to come with -ve impact on margin -- why?</li>
<li>Sold a very long-dated ESTX50 call. I have been burned too much on negative theta positions, and I like to earn a bit of premium while I wait for markets to break.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, yes. I rolled over an NG future because delivering was looming up.</p>

<p>Equities up a bit. No real direction.
Commodities calming down, but Brent dragged down by WTI.</p>
<p>You tried to reduce your margin. Big use is a massive hedged short put in SBUX. 
Put a limit order to close this out at zero. Can't even remember how you got this.
BA and TSLA dragging you down.
You are long one ES, but maybe not enough.
You think you bought this via a trailing stop.
Trying to unwind the GC call spread. 
Although it's limited risk, you are going off gold.
My <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e860e55f05193d872ab038b">Overhyped Stocks</a> list is doing well, but at some point it will fade.</p>

<p>Well, I heard that crude had soared 40% after Donny had tweeted that he was going to fire at Iranian shipping with gunboats. I thought I was toast.
In fact, it wasn't too bad. I was short the Dec. fut, which moved 9%. I doubled down.</p>
<p>I did get hit by a ludicrous short put position in SBUX. 
I had got it hedged, but a 6% move in the underlying completely derailed it.
Big negative portfolio gamma hurt me. I took out the position after discovering that I was (for some unknown reason) long SBUX. I am an idiot.</p>
<p>I did buy some ES on a trailing buy. Closed again.</p>
<p>Overall, a bit sick, but up over the last two days in aggregate, 
and closing the SBUX fuckup cut my margin requirement by $100K.</p>
<p>I increased my exposure to GC. It seems to be moving.</p>
<p>I went short 1 lot ZN. </p>
<p>I sold some calls against my EURN and went deeper long FRO.</p>

<p>At one level, there is no secret to investing. You just buy things cheaply and wait. You wait for the rest of the world catch up with your valuation, so you can sell the things back. Or you wait and receive the income, which is more than you'd get from an expensive or correctly priced investment.</p>
<p>Of course the secret is to know what is cheap. Because this relies on your spotting something that nobody else has.</p>
<p>Value, as far as an investment is concerned, is a future cashflow, either as a payout from the issuer of the security, such as a dividend, or a bond coupon, or the proceeds of a sale. Depending on the nature of the issuer, and the nature of the security, these all are uncertain to some extent.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-golden-rule-buy-low-sell-high" id="the-golden-rule-buy-low-sell-high">The Golden Rule: buy low, sell high</a></h2>
<p>In its very basic form, you will buy shares in a company, ideally earn quarterly dividends, and then sell at a higher price than you paid at the start as the company is deemed by investors to be more valuable than when you started. The share price is a kind of consensus on that valuation, giving the approximate current price that shares are trading hands at.</p>
<p>This presumes that you have money to invest in the first place. Surprisingly, a mechanism called short-selling allows you to work around this limitation. It requires that someone lend you shares that you promise to return at a later time. You would do so if you believe that the price is due to drop soon. You sell the shares, buy the same number back when the price has duly dropped, and then give them back to the lender, pocketing the profit from money you did not have in the first place.</p>
<p>Short-selling also presumes that the lender is not expecting the shares to drop in value, or he might decide to sell them now to avoid a loss.</p>
<p>All investors worry about their exit: converting their paper gains to real assets. For the trader, the exit is the closing of his position, which converts his unrealized profit to a realized profit.</p>
<p>This rule works whether you buy first, or sell first. If you sell first, this is called short selling. It is particularly easy to do this with futures.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#short-selling" id="short-selling">Short selling.</a></h2>
<p>There is nothing mysterious about this.</p>
<p>A 'normal' trade involves handing over cash and receiving the shares. A short sale is just handing over the shares and receiving the cash. If you always start with nothing, you'd have to borrow the shares.</p>
<p>This means that you promise to pay back the cash at some point in the future. The converse also applies.</p>
<p>If you sell short, you promise to repay the shares at some point in the future.<br />
The economic effect is more easily and cheaply achieved by selling a CFD.</p>
<p>In the USA it is also possible to sell a single-stock future.<br />
For indexes, futures and ETFs are also available, and, because stock futures are cash settled you don't ever have to worry about having the stock available to borrow.</p>
<p>Borrowing stock is more difficult than borrowing money because ... well there are many more shares in issue than there are currencies.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#valuation" id="valuation">Valuation</a></h2>
<p>The key to investment is valuation. Making money is easy: find mispriced securities, buy them, and wait for the market to realize its mistake.<br />
Unfortunately there is an extremely well-tested academic theoryEMH that says that securities are never mispriced.</p>
<p>The EMH relates to securities. An equity market index is a weighted mean of a set of stock prices, so it is reasonable to assume that the index will be correctly priced. Lots of analysts and traders are comparing the values of individual stocks and shifting savings between them, so the</p>
<p>EMH at the stock level is likely to hold closely. I believe that it possible that it is possible to detect mispricing between the same asset classes between countries, and between different asset classes within a country.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#yield" id="yield">Yield</a></h2>
<p>Most financial assets produce some kind of income. Not all produce a long-term steady stream, but many do. The ratio of the unit-time income to the price of the asset is known as the yield redemption-yield</p>
<p>[redemption-yield]: when all future cash flows from an asset are known then a redemption yield can be calculated, which is the internal rate of return on the cashflows. This redemption yield can be calculated, only under the assumption of the absence of credit risk.</p>
<p>Shares produce dividends, and so a dividend yield can be calculated for a company, which is comparable to the yield on a bond. However, for most companies, for tax and other reasons, only part of the earnings are paid out, but that which is retained is &quot;really&quot; an addition to the shareholders’ funds, and so another, possibly better, measure of yield is <code>earnings yield', which is the ratio of earnings per share to share price. Going one step further one can define EBITDA, which converts the</code>earnings', which is an accounting concept, to an actual cash flow.</p>
<p>Short dated bills are sold at a discount, so the return is built into the `bullet' redemption when the bill matures. Some shares pay no dividends, especially younger companies that are still in a growth phase, and feel that their assets produce a bigger return on retained earnings than their cost of capital [check this! Check the WB argument about whether it’s right to buy back shares.]</p>
<p>How do you know the price is low if you don’t have a view on what it should be? The sorts of securities we will be selling will be widely held. Presumably most holders are very happy to hold on to their stock of securities (their holdings or position)</p>
<p>Each investor will have a value to him of</p>
<p>$$
\sum_{i} Exp(pv_i )
$$</p>
<p>where $$pv_i = c_i d_i and d_i = d(t_i)$$</p>
<p>and the expectation is formed over the probability distribution for</p>
<p>receiving $ c_i $ at time latexmath: $ t_i $ .</p>
<p>The problem therefore boils down to finding the distribution, $ p_i $ , and, to a lesser extend, the risk-free discount factor $ d(t) $. Because it is so difficult to estimate the distribution, an approximation is often made to just discount the cashflows at a larger discount factor that incorporates both a time element, and risk element, perhaps derived from the cashflows of similarly risky assets.</p>
<p>You may be relieved to read that these mathematical formulations are largely useless. This is because you are substituting one problem: establishing a correct price, for another: constructing a probability distribution.</p>
<p>Note that the discount factor for risk free cashflows reflects the individual investor’s time value of money. [In practice we ignore this: is this reasonable? If someone had a different time preference, would this really affect valuations?]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-securities-exchanges" id="the-importance-of-securities-exchanges">The importance of securities exchanges</a></h2>
<p>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of minimizing the cost of managing a portfolio.<br />
The spread between buying and selling is an important part of this cost.<br />
A stock exchange minimizes this spread by attracting to one place (or at least one platform) all the parties who wish to buy or sell.</p>
<p>If you keep trading to a minimum the spread, even for illiquid shares, should not represent a huge cost. However, futures, at least the most liquid stock index ones, have to be `rolled' every quarter.footnote:[Some futures, especially in the less developed markets need to be rolled every month.]</p>
<p>//// Korea is one, also some of the smaller european markets - Norweigen? Check!</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a tradeoff between getting the exposure you want and the spread you have to pay.<br />
You can get exposure to 600 stocks through the DJ600, compared to only 50 in the ESTX50.<br />
However the latter has lower spreads.<br />
It also has the advantage of being on an an underlying with an active options market.<br />
The other example is the MXEA which would have to be made up of a mixture of European, Japanese, Australian and XXX futures.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#stock-exchanges" id="stock-exchanges">Stock Exchanges</a></h2>
<p>// Deliver price visibility, and, sometimes, settlement services.</p>
<p>I don't discuss trading individual stocks, or bonds, so the main function of the exchange is to generate reliable prices for the components of equity indexes. For various reasons a lot of trading is moving away from exchanges, but for main market shares there should still be sufficient depth to the market to establish reliable prices.</p>
<p>//// Say something about Dark Pools</p>
<p>A marketplace, where buyers and sellers come together to assist price discovery. These days usually coming together in a strictly electronic sense.</p>
<p>Will usually collect bids and offers from participants. Sometimes with specialists, who enjoy certain privileges in exchange for providing liquidity.</p>
<p>Securities exchanges often work to reduce the delivery risk to buyers and sellers by providing some structured settlement system by ensuring transfer of title against payment. They will always attempt to standardize securities. Without standardizing contracts selling and buying become enormously more expensive. God gave us wheat, but the Chicago Board of Trade gave us No. 2 Soft Red Winter Wheat .</p>
<p>////<br />
In practice your broker will make all the decisions about where your trades are executed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#futures" id="futures">Futures</a></h2>
<p>The most basic derivative. Has existed for hundreds of years to meet the demand for farmers to remove risk of an adverse movement in grain prices. A farmer can sell his grain, to remove his risk of the price going down, and a baker can buy this grain, to remove the risk of the price going up. The contract specifies a standard of wheat, and a delivery date. The exchange removes the credit risk that would otherwise exist. Both parties have the exchange as their counter-party. By insisting on all parties providing collateral, the exchange can insulate itself from credit risk. By never entering into a one-sided deal, the exchange isolates itself from market risk.</p>
<p>Futures are generally used to take a strong directional view of an expected price movement. Given constant yield curve and dividend expectations, a future moves in tandem with the cash market, so if you have a view about the underlying market, you can cheaply express it by buying or selling the future. For most futures, the spread, and the liquidity, are excellent, as long as you stick to the nearby contract.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#options" id="options">Options</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of variations on a theme when it comes to options. You not only have options on cash securities, but also options on futures.<br />
With futures, there is usually just one liquid contract, the `near month'. With options, there is a whole two-dimensional space of expiries and strikes, but there will be next to no liquidity in most of this space, so it is important to check the market depth before risking any trading.</p>
<p>Even with the most liquid options, the bid-ask spread is much bigger, certainly as a percentage of the price, so you really don’t want to be opening and closing positions too rapidly.</p>
<p>I tend to trade options to execute a mean-reversion trade. When the market has gone up very rapidly, volatility is likely to be very high, for short-dated options. Writing an option to take advantage of a reversion can work here because even if the market just stays still, you’ll still make money as the option time value decays. Not everyone wants to take the risk that writing `naked' options implies. It is also expensive, in terms of margin usage.<br />
The great advantage of options is that you can protect yourself against so called Black Swan events.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#futures-options" id="futures-options">Futures Options</a></h2>
<p>In many cases the price of the underlying for a future is easily determined. In the case of bond futures, the underlying is one of a number of 'deliverable' bonds, one of which is the 'cheapest to deliver'. The underlying is then, in effect this bond, but which one it is can change from day to day, depending on the exact shape of the discount curve.</p>
<p>To solve the problems with a slighly blurry underling, it's easier to trade options on futures. These are slightly simpler to analyze theoretically, as both the option and the underlying have no carrying cost.</p>
<p>The great advantage of these as tradeable instruments is that if you get cold feet on the direct of the underlying, but already have a futures position, you can write a covered call or put, depending on whether you are long or short the future, to earn a bit of premium income.</p>
<p>When you write options, time is on your side, as if the market is going sideways, you make money. footnote:[This makes assumptions about interest rates and volatility remaining steady. In practice a market that is going sideways will nearly always one where volatility is flat or declining.]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#brokers" id="brokers">Brokers</a></h2>
<p>Exchanges have systems that cannot be accessed directly by end investors. Diversification is important, and having good access to as many exchanges is necessary to get good diversification. Most brokers concentrate in one geographical area (e.g.UK or USA), or in one product area (like futures and options). Many struggle to develop systems which are truly multi-currency. Brokers are supposed to have protocols in place to minimize credit risk: you, as a trader, do not trade with them as a counterparty: they are your agent.</p>
<p>In the area of futures traders, there have been some spectacular failures: MF Global, and Saxo Spreads. Brokers tend to fail at a time of maximum market volatility: the very last time you want to try to change brokers, and take the risk of liquidating and re-establishing a position.</p>
<p>I have found that a good place to start is <a href="http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB51367578116875004693704580500193983582362%5BBarron%E2%80%99s">http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB51367578116875004693704580500193983582362[Barron’s</a> Survey of Online Brokerages]. I personally use Interactive Brokers. They are fairly sophisticated, and are the best that I’ve come across.<br />
Previously I was with Options Xpress, a very good brokerage, owned by Charles Schwab, but one that now focuses almost exclusively on clients based in the USA. My experience is that US-based brokerages are many years ahead of UK or European providers in terms of technology and breadth of product coverage.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#styles-of-investing" id="styles-of-investing">Styles of Investing</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#time-horizons" id="time-horizons">Time Horizons</a></h3>
<p>Some people make a keen distinction between speculating and investing.<br />
The general idea is that investing is finding the highest-quality assets and allocating capital to them for a long time. Warren Buffet’s holding period is, famously, <code>for ever'. Speculating is associated with short-term trading.</code>Day traders' (and most spot FX traders) will open positions after they arrive at work, and close them all out before they go home for the night. An individual will have a time horizon which is determined by the timescale over which he transitions from being a net saver to a net dissaver footnote:[It is not entirely clear to me that, if a fund is managed for a large pool of savers, the time horizon he should focus on should be some average of the economic situation of his investors.].</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#momentum" id="momentum">Momentum</a></h3>
<p>Momentum trading is exactly what it sounds. You wait until you see something go into a <code>bull market' and climb on the bandwagon, making sure that you jump off before it reverses and enters a</code>bear market'. The financial press routinely refers to bull and bear markets as if they self-evidently exist. But the EMH, for which the proposers were awarded a Nobel Prize, postulates that the sort of price behaviour which would give rise to a bull or a bear market simply does not exist.</p>
<p>If one looks at a price history of the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009 to today, it certainly doesn’t look as though it has followed a random walk. In his extensive analysis of investment strategies, XXX has concluded that momentum investing is the only one that produces sustained extraordinary risk-adjusted returns [Reference book on asset returns] .</p>
<p>My view on momentum investing is that by the time a bull market is established the valuation of the asset is too rich for me to want to invest. The S&amp;P500 is now at a very steep valuation, and to buy now is to risk being long when the market crashes. It is certainly the case that markets go up steadily and then crash precipitously.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#growth" id="growth">Growth</a></h2>
<p>Some industries, and companies, are likely to grow faster than others. Internet stocks are likely to grow quicker than steel manufacturers. Given that assets will flow to equalize the returns on the two types of stock, it follows that growth stocks will have a lower yield (dividend, and earnings) than the alternatives.</p>
<p>The growth style of investing tries to identify stocks with genuine growth prospects. This tends to be a popular investment style in a macro environment with strong economic growth.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#value" id="value">Value</a></h2>
<p>Value investing is associated with Ben Graham, ??? Dodd and Warren Buffett. This attempts to examine companies’ accounts closely to identify undervalued companies, especially those which are out of favour whose price has dropped below a 'fair' value. Buffett’s style also attempts to identify sustainable competitive advantage</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sector-rotation" id="sector-rotation">Sector rotation</a></h2>
<p>Sectors go in and out of fashion. Multiples theoretically reflect growth prospects, but growth is something that must come to an end. It is, in general, impossible to know whether a sector is cheap because it is despairately unfashionable, or because there genuinely are a lot of companies in it which are about to fold. It may be that both are applicable.</p>
<p>There is always something being written in Seeking Alpha about which sector is about to come back from the dead, but beware that these are usually written by fans of the sector.</p>
<p>It is generally the case that earnings are much less volatile than a stock price, and that yields are mean-reverting.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#technical-trading-and-mean-reversion" id="technical-trading-and-mean-reversion">Technical Trading and Mean Reversion</a></h2>
<p>Equity markets typically have an annual standard deviation of 20%. This is an annual variance of 4%. A typical daily variance, given there are roughly 200 trading days per year is therefore a typical daily SD is 1.4%, so once or twice a year you can expect to see moves of around 3%. This is a big move, the sort that leads to margin calls and heart attacks for holders of highly geared positions. It is also the sort of move that is likely to prove profitable for those who are confident enough that this does not signal the start of the next bull or bear market and have equity reserves remaining to extend or sustain a position to express this view.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental contradiction between mean reversion and the zero autocorrelation behaviour predicted by the EMH. As a non-trader, I believed that traders could not beat the market, but my practical experience of seeing large moves in the market leads me to believe that mean reversion is a fact of life at extremes of the market. I do not truly know the mechanism for this, but I think that it is something to do with forced closing of positions which are adversely affected by sudden large moves. A brokerage will close out a position when inadequate margin has been posted. Brokerages vary, but none are patient when it comes to waiting for margin calls to be met.</p>
<p>Mean reversion is a dangerous guide to trading. Markets can over-react to all sorts of news, and drift back after a decent interval. However, for some stocks there is no coming back. It seems unlikely that conventional retailers will come back from the existential threat that is Amazon. However, you'd look pretty stupid if you shorted Whole Foods the day before Amazon announced it was intending to take them over.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#macro-trading" id="macro-trading">Macro Trading</a></h2>
<p>Most investors depend on fund managers to make investment decisions for them. Most fund managers are concerned with a small sector of the universe of financial assets. Some will focus on UK large cap stocks, others on small cap, others on emerging markets debt, others on 'special situations' (takeovers and mergers), there are many flavours of debt funds. It is widely known that decisions about asset allocation are usually more important than decisions about individual securities, but these are often taken by default: either by the investor who selects a fund, often based on its recent performance, or marketing, or because a regulator has decreed that certain types of saving must be allocated to 'low risk' assets. This is particularly true of pension savings, which are the biggest source of investment [check this and give reference], where, increasingly, regulators require cashflows from the asset to match the liability. Because cashflows from equities are uncertain, relative to cashflows required to service annuities, this effectively drives savings into fixed-income products.</p>
<p>I believe that by holding a portfolio that has the potential to hold a very wide range of financial assets, it is possible to profit from correctly calling changes in the global economy. This requires an understanding of how different asset classes will react to unexpected changes in the wider economy, and an edge on other investors on predicting the evolution of how the global economy will evolve.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#turning-japanese" id="turning-japanese">Turning Japanese</a></h2>
<p>We live in oriental times. In 1992, because of bad lending to finance property purchases, Japanese banks were pushed to the brink. To avert a collapse of the Japanese economy, the government adopted extreme monetary stimulus, pushing 'risk free' rates down to approximately zero, encourage borrowing and capital investment, and, incidentally, prevent major failures of large banks. When reducing interest rates failed to have the desired effect, the government set about buying assets, particularly government bonds, as a way of continuing the war on stagnation by other means.</p>
<p>Something spookily similar happened in the West in 2008. It was widely expected that flooding the economy with high powered money would cause inflation, and growth, but, as in Japan sixteen years earlier, this didn’t happen. Instead the West joined Japan in a period of weak growth, and low inflation, and a continued bull market in risk free assets. What happens next is the most important question for traders.</p>
<p>Central bank governors in the USA have stated that interest rates are about to start rising. This did actually happen in Japan, but the impact on the economy was so bad that the policy was reversed, and the central bank returned to more 'unconventional' monetary policy, with the government deciding on various policies to boost demand and reduce the rigidity in the supply side of the economy. [Check what the 'three arrows' of Abenomics are: presumably monetary, supply-side reforms and ?foreign exchange policy]</p>
<p>Japan and the West have not followed exactly the same path. The Nikkei is still well below its peak in 1992, whereas the S&amp;P500 has more than tripled since 2009. Bond yields of developed countries throughout the world are hitting their lowest value ever. Strong corporate names can issue paper at unprecedently cheap rates, and have done so, often to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks, but rarely to invest in capital assets, which the possible exception of the Fracking Fraternity.</p>
<p>An investment strategy requires a view of the future. We can envisage (at least) three scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Growth in the world economy picks up smartly, productivity and</p>
<p>labour force participation increase, demand for commodities picks up and</p>
<p>we catch up with the trend growth that applied before 2008. 'Growth'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We hit stagflation: growth remains 'lacklustre' but the huge</p>
<p>quantities of (central bank) money that have been injected leads to</p>
<p>persistent, and possibly accelerating inflation. 'Stagflation'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continue in a low-growth, near-deflationary path indefinitely.</p>
<p>'Japan'</p>
</li>

<p>It seems to me that one big issue to resolve is similarity of what we are going through now, to the situation in Japan around the late nineties. It has been suggested [reference?] that monetary policy in Japan was, and possibly still is, too tight, because the commercial banks inability, or unwillingness to lend.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#japan-scenario" id="japan-scenario">Japan Scenario</a></h2>
<p>As a general rule, we tend to overestimate the probability that things will not change, so the Japan scenario is one we should examine closely. It is not at all clear that the right investment decision in Japan in 1999 will be the right decision here, in the West, today. There was no bull market in equities in Japan up to this point. My tentative view is that, because inflation will remain subdued in this scenario, that fixed income will remain decent investment choice, especially coporate bonds, including sub-investment grade, but only from the strongest names.</p>
<p>Because government bonds have such low yields, for mean reversion reasons, it’s hard to justify putting them into a portfolio at all. Stagflation Scenario</p>
<p>Here we need to get out of bonds. Gold and real estate might do well.</p>

<p>There will come a time when you have been trading securities when an investment decision you have made will appear to go horribly wrong. Your position will show apparently inexorable mounting losses and you will lose faith. You will doubt your analysis, and become convinced that the factors that you previously disregarded that argued against this investment were, in fact, the dominant ones.</p>
<p>If at all possible, do not liquidate. And even more importantly, do not invert the position, going long where you were previously short. That way lies madness. Or at least big losses.</p>
<p>The problem is that, as Keynes said, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Either because you really were wrong in your assessment of value, or because your broker is about to close out all your positions, you may have no options left.</p>
<p>There is no way out of this difficult position, which means that you must take ever precaution possible to avoid getting into it. Where there is a possibility of a big position taking your portfolio down, you should buy out of the money options to insure yourself. Sure, the premiums will erode your returns, but if you weren't ultra-confident that this was a big money-spinner you wouldn't take on the position in the first place: right?</p>
<p>Great investors like Warren Buffett and Ben Graham will make a big distinction between investing and speculating, alternatively between investing and trading. I am not sure that these investors explicitly defined the difference, but the essential difference concerns time horizons. Investors want to get rich slowly but surely.</p>
<p>I take the view that the exchanges and techniques used by traders can be used to improve investment returns. Sure, spreads only hurt you when you buy and when you sell, so if you have a 'buy and hold forever' strategy, they don't hurt you much.</p>
<p>However for most people it makes sense to get cheap funding to establish a long-term position early in their trading career when their financial capital is at a minimum, because that way the returns on their investment have the longest time to compound.</p>

<p>Making money by trading is a piece of cake: buy undervalued securities and sell overvalued ones. This reduces all trading to an exercise in valuation. There is a flaw however: this is a sure-fire way to get rich only over an extremely long time frame. As Keynes memorably put it: &quot;The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.&quot; In other words, you have not only to spot mis-valued securities, but also have some confidence that the marginal buyer and seller are going to come around to your way of thinking in a bearable timescale.</p>
<p>In this chapter I will present a number of approaches to valuation that I have found useful. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to identify mis-valued securities. The market is a crowd, and as Francis Galton spotted, a long time a go, under some reasonable constraints, crowds are remarkably good at estimating things like the correct value of a security. &lt;&lt;#surowiecki, Surowiecki&gt;&gt; has a lot to say about this.</p>

<p>The simplest securities to value are those which are risk free. This simply requires one to know the right discount factor. These discount factors can be inferred from the prices of securities which have risk free cash flows.</p>
<p>In practice the securities used are notes and bonds issued by the government, sometimes enhanced with swaps and futures prices (to extend out the curve to long maturities). Of course, there is some risk associated with these securities, but for practical purposes this is not a problem for valuing a security now, in terms of the prices of securities also trading now. The problem comes when one wants to know what the price of a security will be tomorrow, when the the securities it will be priced off have all changed their prices too.</p>
<p>When trading government bonds with a time horizon measured in years, it is critical to know the likely changes in the yield curve. This can come from changes to government or central bank policy, as well as usual factors of supply and demand.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, if the market has underestimated the extent to which the yield curve will move up then you should be short, and vice versa.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#asset-classes" id="asset-classes">Asset Classes</a></h2>
<p>A lot of rubbish is written about asset classes. The general idea is to increase diversification. Bond prices are driven by interest rates, equity prices by various factors, such as the partition of company income amongst the various factors of production, real economic growth, and many factors specific to certain sectors, or indeed companies. Because the drivers of price across these two asset classes (bonds are different) is is a reasonable expectation that price moves in the two classes will be uncorrelated and hence a portfolio composed of a mixture of the two will have a lower mean variance.</p>
<p>To my mind the most important asset classes are:</p>
<p>. equities, . fixed income, . foreign exchange, and . commodities.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#equities" id="equities">Equities</a></h3>
<p>The limited liability company was a wonderful invention. The existence of shares arises from a set of contractual relationships between principal and agent. The principal is the provider of capital, the agent is the board.<br />
Equity is simply the last security in the queue for receiving the cash from sales made by the company, so it is odd, in some sense, to treat it as a completely separate class. Some securities, preferred shares, have some characteristics of bond, and some of a share. Even corporate bonds, which are, as their name implies, a bond, are, compared to government bonds, equity like. For this reason they are sometimes considered a separate asset class. Clearly, the boundaries between the various classes are somewhat blurred and arbitrary.</p>
<p>The key thing about equities is that they are the most risky of securities issued by any particular company. They pay a dividend only if there are surplus retained earnings. Even if there are retained earnings, a dividend may not be paid: an investor who purchased a Berkshire Hathaway share fifty years ago is still waiting to receive his first dividend cheque. He is not too worried though: the retained earnings are largely reflected in the price of his security, so if he needs the cash he can sell his share, or use it as collateral for a loan. This is why valuation of shares generally focusses more on earnings: the surplus of income over costs, than dividends: cash paid to shareholders.</p>

<p><strong>Market Cap to GDP</strong></p>
<p>The natural question to ask about whether a market is overpriced is 'compared to what?'. A lot of valuation metrics arise from various plausible answers to this question. One answer is ''compared to the economy as a whole''. This is, supposedly, a favourite metric of Warren Buffett. It certainly has the advantage of simplicity. The downside is that it does not look at the shift in companies’ preferred financing strategies. Over time, and between countries, companies finance their capital spending in different ways. Investors’ enthusiasm for equities has resulted in substitution of equity for debt. This certainly happened in the 60’s, and is, arguably, happening now. In continental Europe, even large companies choose bank debt over securities and especially over equity, which is regarded as ''Anglo Saxon capitalism''.</p>

<p>The problem with a lot of equities valuation is the noise caused by the business cycle. The well-known Shiller CAPE attempts to do this by looking back over ten years of earnings, to average out some of the noise.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated attempt is <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/guest/Easterling-So-Many-Choices-Part-1.php%5Bthe">http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/guest/Easterling-So-Many-Choices-Part-1.php[the</a> Crestmont P/E].

<p>In a situation where its impossible to be completely sure that the noise is at an acceptable level, it is best to use as wide a range of indicators, ideally ones which use totally independent statistics.</p>
<p>Note that this is a dimensionally dubious measure: market cap is a 'stock' whereas GDP is a 'flow', therefore the number has the dimensions of time: the number of years the total income of a country would be needed to purchase the totality of its issued equity.</p>

<p>Small cap stocks undoubtedly offer many opportunities for the investor who is prepared to do his homework. Large companies often have many analysts poring over their reported results, and market position, but smaller ones can remain unexamined, leaving them, potentially, as hidden gems. However, the downside is that the shares will be less liquid, so that finding a willing seller may be hard, and, they are likely to be more volatile when they do trade.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#large-cap" id="large-cap">Large Cap</a></h4>
<p>Hidden value in larger stocks is less likely, but at least it's easier to buy and sell them. It is also more likely that it will be possible to get an exposure to them via derivatives. In the UK or US, Contracts for Difference may be available.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#bonds" id="bonds">Bonds</a></h4>
<p>A bond is the purest form of exchanging a fixed value of consumption today for a fixed, but larger, amount of consumption in the future. The fixing is in terms of a fixed amount of currency. Generally, for bonds of maturity more than a few months, a coupon is paid, which complicates the calculation of a redemption yield, but for our purposes simply reassures the investor that the issuer is still making money.</p>
<p>A bond is a <em>transferable</em> debt obligation otherwise it would be much more difficult to invest in it. It's easy enough to loan money, but to get an good handle on the risk that the borrower will repay the loan is a different thing entirely. See <em>credit risk</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Issuers</strong></p>
<p>Corporates and governments issue bonds. Because there are so many corporate issues, all with different maturities and coupons, the only truly liquid bonds are ones issued by governments. These are certainly the only ones on which derivatives are issued, and, realistically, the only ones you want to invest in. Government issues are free of credit risk, but nevertheless carry the risk that inflation will destroy the real value of the investment.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#fx" id="fx">FX</a></h4>
<p>Generally, investing in an 'asset' involves going short cash. In reality, there are many currencies, and it is possible to buy and</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#commodities" id="commodities">Commodities</a></h4>
<p>Commodities have produced spectacular returns for some investors over the last twenty years. There are well-developed and liquid futures markets in many commodities, and in the run up to 2008 commodity prices seemed to be gravity-defying as world demand, particularly from developing markets, outran the ability of miners and farmers to produce the stuff. In a classic cyclical story, the situation now (2015) is the opposite. Prices for commodities seem unable to find a floor as the wave of investment started in the early 2000s continues to produce more than the current demand.</p>
<p>At some point prices will find a floor, production capacity will no longer be able to meet demand, and prices will start their upward march again. Well, this is the simplified story. In practice prices will start to go up, then fall back again, then go up a bit more. In other words, there will be a lot of noise imposed on the orderly development of prices, such that it will be very difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>
<p>Commodity exposure may be obtained via buying physical commodities, via ETFs and ETNs, via derivatives such as options and futures, and via exposure to the securities of mining companies. For example, a bullish view on oil might be expressed via buying shares in Exxon Mobil.</p>
<p>My own preference would be to get exposure to commodities via a suitable index, such as the GSCI. There are liquid futures on this, and it's possible to buy ETFs.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, commodity prices are strongly correlated with inflation. Given that most commodities are priced in US dollars, this really is US price inflation. For an investor based outside the US, it's worth bearing this in mind. If one has a strong directional view on inflation, the alternative to an exposure to commodities is to go long or short government bonds.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#real-estate" id="real-estate">Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>Property produces a stream of income after the initial investment. Although buildings require maintenance and insurance, once they are built they generally are a reliable stream of income, and this income is usually -- depending on the exact terms of the lease -- maintained in real, inflation-adjusted terms.</p>
<p>It is possible to invest in property via securities. Most people are very familiar with the idea of investing in a house, either one to live in, or to rent out. People invest in houses because of familiarity, ease of financing, transparency, and low (or non-existent) management fees, and, in the case of owner-occupation, a absence of tax on the implicit income of living in the property. In the UK there is also very favourable tax treatment of capital gains on disposal of owner occupied property. Moreover, very strict planning laws lead to a highly constricted supply situation. The combination of these factors makes investing in residential property a very popular strategy today.</p>
<p>An alternative to direct exposure to property is purchase of shares in property companies. In recognition of the unequal tax treatment of direct ownership of the asset and ownership via a company, special property companies called REITs have been created, which allow rental income to pass directly to the investor without suffering tax at the company level.</p>
<p>Like commodities, all property investment represents a real asset. Property, because of the pattern of cashflows involved, tends to produce a high and stable cashflow. However, it does not normally offer the possibility of rapid capital appreciation.</p>
<p>My own view is that real estate is highly overrated as a investment, but has a role as part of a balance portfolio. If you feel you need to invest, invest in a REIT, or a REIT ETF. If you need gearing, then use a CFD on such a REIT (e.g. on VNQ). If you really need to get exposure to residential UK property beyond that which you already have if you own your own house, then look at one of the AIM-listed vehicles. There are very few funds which offer this sort of exposure. I am not sure why, but it might be because of the restrictions on pension funds being allowed to invest in residential property.</p>

There are well-developed and liquid futures markets in many commodities, and in the run up to 2008 commodity prices seemed to be gravity-defying as world demand, particularly from developing markets, outran the ability of miners and farmers to produce the stuff. In a classic cyclical story, the situation now (2015) is the opposite. Prices for commodities seem unable to find a floor as the wave of investment started in the early 2000s continues to produce more than the current demand.</p>
<p>At some point prices will find a floor, production capacity will no longer be able to meet demand, and prices will start their upward march again. Well, this is the simplified story. In practice prices will start to go up, then fall back again, then go up a bit more. In other words, there will be a lot of noise imposed on the orderly development of prices, such that it will be very difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>
<p>Commodity exposure may be obtained via buying physical commodities, via ETFs and ETNs, via derivatives such as options and futures, and via exposure to the securities of mining companies. For example, a bullish view on oil might be expressed via buying shares in Exxon Mobil.</p>
<p>My own preference would be to get exposure to commodities via a suitable index, such as the GSCI. There are liquid futures on this, and it's possible to buy ETFs.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, commodity prices are strongly correlated with inflation. Given that most commodities are priced in US dollars, this really is US price inflation. For an investor based outside the US, it's worth bearing this in mind. If one has a strong directional view on inflation, the alternative to an exposure to commodities is to go long or short government bonds.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#real-estate-1" id="real-estate-1">Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>Property produces a stream of income after the initial investment. Although buildings require maintenance and insurance, once they are built they generally are a reliable stream of income, and this income is usually -- depending on the exact terms of the lease -- maintained in real, inflation-adjusted terms.</p>
<p>It is possible to invest in property via securities. Most people are very familiar with the idea of investing in a house, either one to live in, or to rent out. People invest in houses because of familiarity, ease of financing, transparency, and low (or non-existent) management fees, and, in the case of owner-occupation, a absence of tax on the implicit income of living in the property. In the UK there is also very favourable tax treatment of capital gains on disposal of owner occupied property. Moreover, very strict planning laws lead to a highly constricted supply situation. The combination of these factors makes investing in residential property a very popular strategy today.</p>
<p>An alternative to direct exposure to property is purchase of shares in property companies. In recognition of the unequal tax treatment of direct ownership of the asset and ownership via a company, special property companies called REITs have been created, which allow rental income to pass directly to the investor without suffering tax at the company level.</p>
<p>Like commodities, all property investment represents a real asset. Property, because of the pattern of cashflows involved, tends to produce a high and stable cashflow. However, it does not normally offer the possibility of rapid capital appreciation.</p>
<p>My own view is that real estate is highly overrated as a investment, but has a role as part of a balance portfolio. If you feel you need to invest, invest in a REIT, or a REIT ETF. If you need gearing, then use a CFD on such a REIT (e.g. on VNQ). If you really need to get exposure to residential UK property beyond that which you already have if you own your own house, then look at one of the AIM-listed vehicles. There are very few funds which offer this sort of exposure. I am not sure why, but it might be because of the restrictions on pension funds being allowed to invest in residential property.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#all-weather-portfolios" id="all-weather-portfolios">All Weather Portfolios</a></h1>
<p>The general idea of this is that timing the market is a mugs game, and that by choosing the appropriate mixture of asset types a portfolio can be constructed to withstand all types of 'weather'.<br />
The earliest idea was a mixture of domestic stocks and bonds (often in a 60:40 mix), but as other asset types have become more investable, this has been extended with new ingredients: TIPs, overseas equities, high yield bonds, commodities etc.</p>
<p>My own view is that at some point the long bull market in bonds is going to unravel and we are going to see a pickup of inflation that will progressively destroy bond returns. I believe that it is very important to remain calm in the face of losses, and resist the siren song to keep the faith in your original investment decisions.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#commodity-futures-etfs" id="commodity-futures-etfs">Commodity Futures ETFs</a></h2>
<p>These are ETFs that give investors an exposure to commodities without having to trade directly in the futures. Brokerages are reluctant, quite properly, to allow inexperienced investors to trade in futures because of the very high gearing that is possible using them. The ETFs have few assets under management by the standards of SPY and the big index-tracking funds. The strategies vary widely between funds, and are not at all transparent. The fees are high. The historical performance is poor. The sector is not popular, for these reasons.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#trading-1" id="trading-1">Trading</a></h1>
<p>At one level, there is no secret to investing. You just buy things cheaply and wait. You wait for the rest of the world catch up with your valuation, so you can sell the things back. Or you wait and receive the income, which is more than you'd get from an expensive or correctly priced investment.</p>
<p>Of course the secret is to know what is cheap. Because this relies on your spotting something that nobody else has.</p>
<p>Value, as far as an investment is concerned, is a future cashflow, either as a payout from the issuer of the security, such as a dividend, or a bond coupon, or the proceeds of a sale. Depending on the nature of the issuer, and the nature of the security, these all are uncertain to some extent.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-golden-rule-buy-low-sell-high-1" id="the-golden-rule-buy-low-sell-high-1">The Golden Rule: buy low, sell high</a></h2>
<p>In its very basic form, you will buy shares in a company, ideally earn quarterly dividends, and then sell at a higher price than you paid at the start as the company is deemed by investors to be more valuable than when you started. The share price is a kind of consensus on that valuation, giving the approximate current price that shares are trading hands at.</p>
<p>This presumes that you have money to invest in the first place. Surprisingly, a mechanism called short-selling allows you to work around this limitation. It requires that someone lend you shares that you promise to return at a later time. You would do so if you believe that the price is due to drop soon. You sell the shares, buy the same number back when the price has duly dropped, and then give them back to the lender, pocketing the profit from money you did not have in the first place.</p>
<p>Short-selling also presumes that the lender is not expecting the shares to drop in value, or he might decide to sell them now to avoid a loss.</p>
<p>All investors worry about their exit: converting their paper gains to real assets. For the trader, the exit is the closing of his position, which converts his unrealized profit to a realized profit.</p>
<p>This rule works whether you buy first, or sell first. If you sell first, this is called short selling. It is particularly easy to do this with futures.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#short-selling-1" id="short-selling-1">Short selling.</a></h2>
<p>There is nothing mysterious about this.</p>
<p>A 'normal' trade involves handing over cash and receiving the shares. A short sale is just handing over the shares and receiving the cash. If you always start with nothing, you'd have to borrow the shares.</p>
<p>This means that you promise to pay back the cash at some point in the future. The converse also applies.</p>
<p>If you sell short, you promise to repay the shares at some point in the future.<br />
The economic effect is more easily and cheaply achieved by selling a CFD.</p>
<p>In the USA it is also possible to sell a single-stock future.<br />
For indexes, futures and ETFs are also available, and, because stock futures are cash settled you don't ever have to worry about having the stock available to borrow.</p>
<p>Borrowing stock is more difficult than borrowing money because ... well there are many more shares in issue than there are currencies.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#valuation-5" id="valuation-5">Valuation</a></h2>
<p>The key to investment is valuation. Making money is easy: find mispriced securities, buy them, and wait for the market to realize its mistake.<br />
Unfortunately there is an extremely well-tested academic theoryEMH that says that securities are never mispriced.</p>
<p>The EMH relates to securities. An equity market index is a weighted mean of a set of stock prices, so it is reasonable to assume that the index will be correctly priced. Lots of analysts and traders are comparing the values of individual stocks and shifting savings between them, so the</p>
<p>EMH at the stock level is likely to hold closely. I believe that it possible that it is possible to detect mispricing between the same asset classes between countries, and between different asset classes within a country.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#yield-1" id="yield-1">Yield</a></h2>
<p>Most financial assets produce some kind of income. Not all produce a long-term steady stream, but many do. The ratio of the unit-time income to the price of the asset is known as the yield redemption-yield</p>
<p>[redemption-yield]: when all future cash flows from an asset are known then a redemption yield can be calculated, which is the internal rate of return on the cashflows. This redemption yield can be calculated, only under the assumption of the absence of credit risk.</p>
<p>Shares produce dividends, and so a dividend yield can be calculated for a company, which is comparable to the yield on a bond. However, for most companies, for tax and other reasons, only part of the earnings are paid out, but that which is retained is &quot;really&quot; an addition to the shareholders’ funds, and so another, possibly better, measure of yield is <code>earnings yield', which is the ratio of earnings per share to share price. Going one step further one can define EBITDA, which converts the</code>earnings', which is an accounting concept, to an actual cash flow.</p>
<p>Short dated bills are sold at a discount, so the return is built into the `bullet' redemption when the bill matures. Some shares pay no dividends, especially younger companies that are still in a growth phase, and feel that their assets produce a bigger return on retained earnings than their cost of capital [check this! Check the WB argument about whether it’s right to buy back shares.]</p>
<p>How do you know the price is low if you don’t have a view on what it should be? The sorts of securities we will be selling will be widely held. Presumably most holders are very happy to hold on to their stock of securities (their holdings or position)</p>
<p>Each investor will have a value to him of</p>
<p>$$
\sum_{i} Exp(pv_i )
$$</p>
<p>where $$pv_i = c_i d_i and d_i = d(t_i)$$</p>
<p>and the expectation is formed over the probability distribution for</p>
<p>receiving $ c_i $ at time latexmath: $ t_i $ .</p>
<p>The problem therefore boils down to finding the distribution, $ p_i $ , and, to a lesser extend, the risk-free discount factor $ d(t) $. Because it is so difficult to estimate the distribution, an approximation is often made to just discount the cashflows at a larger discount factor that incorporates both a time element, and risk element, perhaps derived from the cashflows of similarly risky assets.</p>
<p>You may be relieved to read that these mathematical formulations are largely useless. This is because you are substituting one problem: establishing a correct price, for another: constructing a probability distribution.</p>
<p>Note that the discount factor for risk free cashflows reflects the individual investor’s time value of money. [In practice we ignore this: is this reasonable? If someone had a different time preference, would this really affect valuations?]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-securities-exchanges-1" id="the-importance-of-securities-exchanges-1">The importance of securities exchanges</a></h2>
<p>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of minimizing the cost of managing a portfolio.<br />
The spread between buying and selling is an important part of this cost.<br />
A stock exchange minimizes this spread by attracting to one place (or at least one platform) all the parties who wish to buy or sell.</p>
<p>If you keep trading to a minimum the spread, even for illiquid shares, should not represent a huge cost. However, futures, at least the most liquid stock index ones, have to be `rolled' every quarter.footnote:[Some futures, especially in the less developed markets need to be rolled every month.]</p>
<p>//// Korea is one, also some of the smaller european markets - Norweigen? Check!</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a tradeoff between getting the exposure you want and the spread you have to pay.<br />
You can get exposure to 600 stocks through the DJ600, compared to only 50 in the ESTX50.<br />
However the latter has lower spreads.<br />
It also has the advantage of being on an an underlying with an active options market.<br />
The other example is the MXEA which would have to be made up of a mixture of European, Japanese, Australian and XXX futures.</p>
<p>//// rewrite this.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#stock-exchanges-1" id="stock-exchanges-1">Stock Exchanges</a></h2>
<p>// Deliver price visibility, and, sometimes, settlement services.</p>
<p>I don't discuss trading individual stocks, or bonds, so the main function of the exchange is to generate reliable prices for the components of equity indexes. For various reasons a lot of trading is moving away from exchanges, but for main market shares there should still be sufficient depth to the market to establish reliable prices.</p>
<p>//// Say something about Dark Pools</p>
<p>A marketplace, where buyers and sellers come together to assist price discovery. These days usually coming together in a strictly electronic sense.</p>
<p>Will usually collect bids and offers from participants. Sometimes with specialists, who enjoy certain privileges in exchange for providing liquidity.</p>
<p>Securities exchanges often work to reduce the delivery risk to buyers and sellers by providing some structured settlement system by ensuring transfer of title against payment. They will always attempt to standardize securities. Without standardizing contracts selling and buying become enormously more expensive. God gave us wheat, but the Chicago Board of Trade gave us No. 2 Soft Red Winter Wheat .</p>
<p>////<br />
In practice your broker will make all the decisions about where your trades are executed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#futures-1" id="futures-1">Futures</a></h2>
<p>The most basic derivative. Has existed for hundreds of years to meet the demand for farmers to remove risk of an adverse movement in grain prices. A farmer can sell his grain, to remove his risk of the price going down, and a baker can buy this grain, to remove the risk of the price going up. The contract specifies a standard of wheat, and a delivery date. The exchange removes the credit risk that would otherwise exist. Both parties have the exchange as their counter-party. By insisting on all parties providing collateral, the exchange can insulate itself from credit risk. By never entering into a one-sided deal, the exchange isolates itself from market risk.</p>
<p>Futures are generally used to take a strong directional view of an expected price movement. Given constant yield curve and dividend expectations, a future moves in tandem with the cash market, so if you have a view about the underlying market, you can cheaply express it by buying or selling the future. For most futures, the spread, and the liquidity, are excellent, as long as you stick to the nearby contract.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#options-1" id="options-1">Options</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of variations on a theme when it comes to options. You not only have options on cash securities, but also options on futures.<br />
With futures, there is usually just one liquid contract, the `near month'. With options, there is a whole two-dimensional space of expiries and strikes, but there will be next to no liquidity in most of this space, so it is important to check the market depth before risking any trading.</p>
<p>Even with the most liquid options, the bid-ask spread is much bigger, certainly as a percentage of the price, so you really don’t want to be opening and closing positions too rapidly.</p>
<p>I tend to trade options to execute a mean-reversion trade. When the market has gone up very rapidly, volatility is likely to be very high, for short-dated options. Writing an option to take advantage of a reversion can work here because even if the market just stays still, you’ll still make money as the option time value decays. Not everyone wants to take the risk that writing `naked' options implies. It is also expensive, in terms of margin usage.<br />
The great advantage of options is that you can protect yourself against so called Black Swan events.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#futures-options-1" id="futures-options-1">Futures Options</a></h2>
<p>In many cases the price of the underlying for a future is easily determined. In the case of bond futures, the underlying is one of a number of 'deliverable' bonds, one of which is the 'cheapest to deliver'. The underlying is then, in effect this bond, but which one it is can change from day to day, depending on the exact shape of the discount curve.</p>
<p>To solve the problems with a slighly blurry underling, it's easier to trade options on futures. These are slightly simpler to analyze theoretically, as both the option and the underlying have no carrying cost.</p>
<p>The great advantage of these as tradeable instruments is that if you get cold feet on the direct of the underlying, but already have a futures position, you can write a covered call or put, depending on whether you are long or short the future, to earn a bit of premium income.</p>
<p>When you write options, time is on your side, as if the market is going sideways, you make money. footnote:[This makes assumptions about interest rates and volatility remaining steady. In practice a market that is going sideways will nearly always one where volatility is flat or declining.]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#brokers-1" id="brokers-1">Brokers</a></h2>
<p>Exchanges have systems that cannot be accessed directly by end investors. Diversification is important, and having good access to as many exchanges is necessary to get good diversification. Most brokers concentrate in one geographical area (e.g.UK or USA), or in one product area (like futures and options). Many struggle to develop systems which are truly multi-currency. Brokers are supposed to have protocols in place to minimize credit risk: you, as a trader, do not trade with them as a counterparty: they are your agent.</p>
<p>In the area of futures traders, there have been some spectacular failures: MF Global, and Saxo Spreads. Brokers tend to fail at a time of maximum market volatility: the very last time you want to try to change brokers, and take the risk of liquidating and re-establishing a position.</p>
<p>I have found that a good place to start is <a href="http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB51367578116875004693704580500193983582362%5BBarron%E2%80%99s">http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB51367578116875004693704580500193983582362[Barron’s</a> Survey of Online Brokerages]. I personally use Interactive Brokers. They are fairly sophisticated, and are the best that I’ve come across.<br />
Previously I was with Options Xpress, a very good brokerage, owned by Charles Schwab, but one that now focuses almost exclusively on clients based in the USA. My experience is that US-based brokerages are many years ahead of UK or European providers in terms of technology and breadth of product coverage.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#styles-of-investing-1" id="styles-of-investing-1">Styles of Investing</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#time-horizons-1" id="time-horizons-1">Time Horizons</a></h3>
<p>Some people make a keen distinction between speculating and investing.<br />
The general idea is that investing is finding the highest-quality assets and allocating capital to them for a long time. Warren Buffet’s holding period is, famously, <code>for ever'. Speculating is associated with short-term trading.</code>Day traders' (and most spot FX traders) will open positions after they arrive at work, and close them all out before they go home for the night. An individual will have a time horizon which is determined by the timescale over which he transitions from being a net saver to a net dissaver footnote:[It is not entirely clear to me that, if a fund is managed for a large pool of savers, the time horizon he should focus on should be some average of the economic situation of his investors.].</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#momentum-1" id="momentum-1">Momentum</a></h3>
<p>Momentum trading is exactly what it sounds. You wait until you see something go into a <code>bull market' and climb on the bandwagon, making sure that you jump off before it reverses and enters a</code>bear market'. The financial press routinely refers to bull and bear markets as if they self-evidently exist. But the EMH, for which the proposers were awarded a Nobel Prize, postulates that the sort of price behaviour which would give rise to a bull or a bear market simply does not exist.</p>
<p>If one looks at a price history of the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009 to today, it certainly doesn’t look as though it has followed a random walk. In his extensive analysis of investment strategies, XXX has concluded that momentum investing is the only one that produces sustained extraordinary risk-adjusted returns [Reference book on asset returns] .</p>
<p>My view on momentum investing is that by the time a bull market is established the valuation of the asset is too rich for me to want to invest. The S&amp;P500 is now at a very steep valuation, and to buy now is to risk being long when the market crashes. It is certainly the case that markets go up steadily and then crash precipitously.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#growth-1" id="growth-1">Growth</a></h2>
<p>Some industries, and companies, are likely to grow faster than others. Internet stocks are likely to grow quicker than steel manufacturers. Given that assets will flow to equalize the returns on the two types of stock, it follows that growth stocks will have a lower yield (dividend, and earnings) than the alternatives.</p>
<p>The growth style of investing tries to identify stocks with genuine growth prospects. This tends to be a popular investment style in a macro environment with strong economic growth.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#value-1" id="value-1">Value</a></h2>
<p>Value investing is associated with Ben Graham, ??? Dodd and Warren Buffett. This attempts to examine companies’ accounts closely to identify undervalued companies, especially those which are out of favour whose price has dropped below a 'fair' value. Buffett’s style also attempts to identify sustainable competitive advantage</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sector-rotation-1" id="sector-rotation-1">Sector rotation</a></h2>
<p>Sectors go in and out of fashion. Multiples theoretically reflect growth prospects, but growth is something that must come to an end. It is, in general, impossible to know whether a sector is cheap because it is despairately unfashionable, or because there genuinely are a lot of companies in it which are about to fold. It may be that both are applicable.</p>
<p>There is always something being written in Seeking Alpha about which sector is about to come back from the dead, but beware that these are usually written by fans of the sector.</p>
<p>It is generally the case that earnings are much less volatile than a stock price, and that yields are mean-reverting.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#technical-trading-and-mean-reversion-1" id="technical-trading-and-mean-reversion-1">Technical Trading and Mean Reversion</a></h2>
<p>Equity markets typically have an annual standard deviation of 20%. This is an annual variance of 4%. A typical daily variance, given there are roughly 200 trading days per year is therefore a typical daily SD is 1.4%, so once or twice a year you can expect to see moves of around 3%. This is a big move, the sort that leads to margin calls and heart attacks for holders of highly geared positions. It is also the sort of move that is likely to prove profitable for those who are confident enough that this does not signal the start of the next bull or bear market and have equity reserves remaining to extend or sustain a position to express this view.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental contradiction between mean reversion and the zero autocorrelation behaviour predicted by the EMH. As a non-trader, I believed that traders could not beat the market, but my practical experience of seeing large moves in the market leads me to believe that mean reversion is a fact of life at extremes of the market. I do not truly know the mechanism for this, but I think that it is something to do with forced closing of positions which are adversely affected by sudden large moves. A brokerage will close out a position when inadequate margin has been posted. Brokerages vary, but none are patient when it comes to waiting for margin calls to be met.</p>
<p>Mean reversion is a dangerous guide to trading. Markets can over-react to all sorts of news, and drift back after a decent interval. However, for some stocks there is no coming back. It seems unlikely that conventional retailers will come back from the existential threat that is Amazon. However, you'd look pretty stupid if you shorted Whole Foods the day before Amazon announced it was intending to take them over.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#macro-trading-1" id="macro-trading-1">Macro Trading</a></h2>
<p>Most investors depend on fund managers to make investment decisions for them. Most fund managers are concerned with a small sector of the universe of financial assets. Some will focus on UK large cap stocks, others on small cap, others on emerging markets debt, others on 'special situations' (takeovers and mergers), there are many flavours of debt funds. It is widely known that decisions about asset allocation are usually more important than decisions about individual securities, but these are often taken by default: either by the investor who selects a fund, often based on its recent performance, or marketing, or because a regulator has decreed that certain types of saving must be allocated to 'low risk' assets. This is particularly true of pension savings, which are the biggest source of investment [check this and give reference], where, increasingly, regulators require cashflows from the asset to match the liability. Because cashflows from equities are uncertain, relative to cashflows required to service annuities, this effectively drives savings into fixed-income products.</p>
<p>I believe that by holding a portfolio that has the potential to hold a very wide range of financial assets, it is possible to profit from correctly calling changes in the global economy. This requires an understanding of how different asset classes will react to unexpected changes in the wider economy, and an edge on other investors on predicting the evolution of how the global economy will evolve.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#turning-japanese-1" id="turning-japanese-1">Turning Japanese</a></h2>
<p>We live in oriental times. In 1992, because of bad lending to finance property purchases, Japanese banks were pushed to the brink. To avert a collapse of the Japanese economy, the government adopted extreme monetary stimulus, pushing 'risk free' rates down to approximately zero, encourage borrowing and capital investment, and, incidentally, prevent major failures of large banks. When reducing interest rates failed to have the desired effect, the government set about buying assets, particularly government bonds, as a way of continuing the war on stagnation by other means.</p>
<p>Something spookily similar happened in the West in 2008. It was widely expected that flooding the economy with high powered money would cause inflation, and growth, but, as in Japan sixteen years earlier, this didn’t happen. Instead the West joined Japan in a period of weak growth, and low inflation, and a continued bull market in risk free assets. What happens next is the most important question for traders.</p>
<p>Central bank governors in the USA have stated that interest rates are about to start rising. This did actually happen in Japan, but the impact on the economy was so bad that the policy was reversed, and the central bank returned to more 'unconventional' monetary policy, with the government deciding on various policies to boost demand and reduce the rigidity in the supply side of the economy. [Check what the 'three arrows' of Abenomics are: presumably monetary, supply-side reforms and ?foreign exchange policy]</p>
<p>Japan and the West have not followed exactly the same path. The Nikkei is still well below its peak in 1992, whereas the S&amp;P500 has more than tripled since 2009. Bond yields of developed countries throughout the world are hitting their lowest value ever. Strong corporate names can issue paper at unprecedently cheap rates, and have done so, often to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks, but rarely to invest in capital assets, which the possible exception of the Fracking Fraternity.</p>
<p>An investment strategy requires a view of the future. We can envisage (at least) three scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Growth in the world economy picks up smartly, productivity and</p>
<p>labour force participation increase, demand for commodities picks up and</p>
<p>we catch up with the trend growth that applied before 2008. 'Growth'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We hit stagflation: growth remains 'lacklustre' but the huge</p>
<p>quantities of (central bank) money that have been injected leads to</p>
<p>persistent, and possibly accelerating inflation. 'Stagflation'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continue in a low-growth, near-deflationary path indefinitely.</p>
<p>'Japan'</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems to me that one big issue to resolve is similarity of what we are going through now, to the situation in Japan around the late nineties. It has been suggested [reference?] that monetary policy in Japan was, and possibly still is, too tight, because the commercial banks inability, or unwillingness to lend.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#japan-scenario-1" id="japan-scenario-1">Japan Scenario</a></h2>
<p>As a general rule, we tend to overestimate the probability that things will not change, so the Japan scenario is one we should examine closely. It is not at all clear that the right investment decision in Japan in 1999 will be the right decision here, in the West, today. There was no bull market in equities in Japan up to this point. My tentative view is that, because inflation will remain subdued in this scenario, that fixed income will remain decent investment choice, especially coporate bonds, including sub-investment grade, but only from the strongest names.</p>
<p>Because government bonds have such low yields, for mean reversion reasons, it’s hard to justify putting them into a portfolio at all. Stagflation Scenario</p>
<p>Here we need to get out of bonds. Gold and real estate might do well.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-holding-your-nerve-1" id="the-importance-of-holding-your-nerve-1">The importance of holding your nerve</a></h2>
<p>There will come a time when you have been trading securities when an investment decision you have made will appear to go horribly wrong. Your position will show apparently inexorable mounting losses and you will lose faith. You will doubt your analysis, and become convinced that the factors that you previously disregarded that argued against this investment were, in fact, the dominant ones.</p>
<p>If at all possible, do not liquidate. And even more importantly, do not invert the position, going long where you were previously short. That way lies madness. Or at least big losses.</p>
<p>The problem is that, as Keynes said, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Either because you really were wrong in your assessment of value, or because your broker is about to close out all your positions, you may have no options left.</p>
<p>There is no way out of this difficult position, which means that you must take ever precaution possible to avoid getting into it. Where there is a possibility of a big position taking your portfolio down, you should buy out of the money options to insure yourself. Sure, the premiums will erode your returns, but if you weren't ultra-confident that this was a big money-spinner you wouldn't take on the position in the first place: right?</p>
<p>Great investors like Warren Buffett and Ben Graham will make a big distinction between investing and speculating, alternatively between investing and trading. I am not sure that these investors explicitly defined the difference, but the essential difference concerns time horizons. Investors want to get rich slowly but surely.</p>
<p>I take the view that the exchanges and techniques used by traders can be used to improve investment returns. Sure, spreads only hurt you when you buy and when you sell, so if you have a 'buy and hold forever' strategy, they don't hurt you much.</p>
<p>However for most people it makes sense to get cheap funding to establish a long-term position early in their trading career when their financial capital is at a minimum, because that way the returns on their investment have the longest time to compound.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#miller-mogdiliani-theorem" id="miller-mogdiliani-theorem">Miller Mogdiliani Theorem</a></h2>
<p>The '<code>no magic in gearing</code>' theorem. States that, in a slightly idealized<br />
world in which there are no taxes on dividends, profits or bond<br />

but I rather admire it.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#open-interest" id="open-interest">open interest</a></h2>
<p>The number of derivatives contract that have not been closed. E.g. a new<br />
futures contract starts trading, you buy 1 contract ('<code>lot</code>' <code>lot</code>), by entering<br />
into a trade with a [.term]counterparty who sells you the lot. At this point,<br />
if no other trades have taken place, you the open interest for this<br />
contract is exactly one. Open Interest is a <strong>stock</strong>, Volume is a<br />
<strong>flow</strong>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#reits" id="reits">reits</a></h2>
<p>Real Estate Investment Trust. Tax privileged corporate structure that<br />

<h2><a class="header" href="#volume" id="volume">volume</a></h2>
<p>Trading volume, amount of stuff changing hands.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#position" id="position">position</a></h2>
<p>The stock of securities held by an investor. I.e. your portfolio: the<br />
set of things you own. Ownership is used in a legal, but otherwise vague<br />
sense. Your position is also known as your holdings: the stuff you own!</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#market-price" id="market-price">market price</a></h2>
<p>The price at which the supply and demand schedules for a security are in<br />
balance. See also bid price, last price, offer price and NBBO.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#carry-cost" id="carry-cost">carry cost</a></h2>
<p>To understand the net return on a portfolio it is best to imagine<br />
creating it ex nihilo. To acquire assets it is then necessary to borrow,<br />
typically by borrowing (shorting) your home currency, or some other<br />
funding source. Although people do not always think about equity<br />
porfolios this way, it is actually a useful way to think about whether<br />
or not an investment really is worth making. It might sound good to hold<br />
a share portfolio for a year and show a total return of 10%, but if<br />
short term interest rates are running at 12% it suddenly doesn’t sound<br />
so smart any more.<br />
Because the Yen was, for so long, the currency with the cheapest carry<br />
cost, it became very common, and profitable, to put on a '<code>Yen carry     trade</code>', which involves selling the Yen against (for example) the dollar.<br />
Because the long asset has the higher yield, this was a profitable<br />
trade. Clearly the danger is that the Yen goes up before the redemption<br />
date. This is exactly what simple arbitrage considerations would leave<br />
us to believe.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mean-reversion" id="mean-reversion">mean reversion</a></h2>
<p>Certain prices have mean reverting behaviour. Yields cannot go up, or<br />
down, forever. Reversing a trend, though, can take a long, and variable,<br />
time. I think that yields tend to mean revert, but it's not clear if equity prices do so.</p>

<p>EAFE index (Europe Australia and Far East) future. Basically the developed world stocks that are outside the US and Canada. To get a whole-world exposure to developed markets, mix with SPX.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#global-financial-crisis" id="global-financial-crisis">Global Financial Crisis</a></h2>
<p>The events of 2007 which caused such a dislocation to growth in most countries on the globe.<br />
Probably still the dominant policy headache for governments even today, eight years later.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mean-variance" id="mean-variance">Mean Variance</a></h2>
<p>This is the square of the standard deviation. It is the best simple single measure of risk of a security or of a portfolio. The variance of a portfolio is simply related to the variance of each component and all the covariances of the components.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#execution-only" id="execution-only">Execution Only</a></h2>
<p>This, in the context of brokers, means an account where no advice is given. Traditionally, brokers would undertake research to give their clients ideas about how to trade. With so much excellent analysis available on the Internet for free, this is, increasingly,<br />
an outdated model. Even if a brokerage produces excellent research, of a standard which gives it monetary value, it is unlikely that the same brokerage would be the best for pure execution. Historically, broker commissions were fixed, so they competed on the quality of their research and other service. This, in the UK, came to an abrupt halt in 1986, the year of the 'Big Bang'.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#black-swan" id="black-swan">Black Swan</a></h2>
<p>This is an event that you would expect 'never' to occur given the probability distribution baked into the models that are conventionally used to value derivatives that depend on knowing this distribution.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#contract-for-difference" id="contract-for-difference">Contract for Difference</a></h2>
<p>Better known as a CFD, this is a straighforward derivative that gives a direct, geared exposure to a stock.<br />

<h1><a class="header" href="#stock-tickers" id="stock-tickers">Stock Tickers</a></h1>
<p>VRX:: Valeant. Stock and CFD. Pharma stock. Subject to a big battle involving Pershing Capital, run by Bill Ackman. Considered to be playing fast and loose with sales methods.</p>
<p>SPX :: The S&amp;P 500 Index accounts for approximately 40% of total global stockmarket capitalization. It is by far the most important stock market index in the world. Exposure can be obtained by trading SP futures, or by ES futures. The latter is one fifth the size of the former (the so-called 'mini' future, which is worth 50 times the value of the index). +</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If one security must be picked to represent 'the stockmarket' this is it. Note that this contains some Canadian stocks. +</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of CFDs that offer an exposure to this index. The most liquid is SPY, but others may offer the same exposure with lower charges, such as VTI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>EIS:: The STOXX 600 insurance sector index future. There are tickers for all sectors within the STOXX 600, but this is one I have recently been trading. It is reasonably liquid, but of course does not have the liquidity of the ESTX50.</p>
<p>EAFE:: 'Europe, Australasia and the Far East'. The MSCI index for developed markets outside of North America.</p>
<p>MXEA:: is the ICE future which tracks this index. Basically this is the 'Rest of the World' as far as the US is concerned. A 60:40 mix of SPX and EAFE will give you a market cap weighted exposure to global stockmarkets with just two securities. + + The linked CFD is EFA.</p>
<p>NQ:: The Nasdaq index future. One hundred, mainly high-tech stocks. Several CFDs, notably QQQ.</p>
<p>RDXUSD:: Russian ADR index. There is a Micex future, but it is much less easily traded, at least for westerners.</p>
<p>TOPX:: The Tokyo TOPIX index future.</p>
<p>XINA50:: China 50 index, traded at SGX. Long trading hours through UK day.</p>
<p>ESTX50:: STOXX 50 index. Good liquidity in futures, options, and futures options.</p>
<p>STX50:: Dollar-denominated version of ESTX50.</p>
<p>DJ600:: Full 600 constituent index. Futures contract, but no options.</p>
