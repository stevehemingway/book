## Miller Mogdiliani Theorem

The '`no magic in gearing`' theorem. States that, in a slightly idealized  
world in which there are no taxes on dividends, profits or bond  
interest. Most practitioners probably think that this is total rubbish,  
but I rather admire it.

## Routing of Trades

Your trade may not be executed where you think it was going to be.  
The SEC puts an obligation on brokers to '`be reasonable`' about this.

## efficient market hypothesis

The idea that the price of a security reflects all publicly available  
information about it at all times.

## credit risk

non performance of contract.

## cult of equity

Ross Goobey, 50’s

## market risk

Risk arising from the fact that the price of securities in the future is  
a random variable.

## open interest

The number of derivatives contract that have not been closed. E.g. a new  
futures contract starts trading, you buy 1 contract \('`lot`' `lot`\), by entering  
into a trade with a \[.term\]counterparty who sells you the lot. At this point,  
if no other trades have taken place, you the open interest for this  
contract is exactly one. Open Interest is a **stock**, Volume is a  
**flow**.

## reits

Real Estate Investment Trust. Tax privileged corporate structure that  
gives a relatively pure exposure to developed \(completed\) commercial and  
residential real estate. Residential REITs have various problems to do  
with tax.

## volume

Trading volume, amount of stuff changing hands.

## position

The stock of securities held by an investor. I.e. your portfolio: the  
set of things you own. Ownership is used in a legal, but otherwise vague  
sense. Your position is also known as your holdings: the stuff you own!

## market price

The price at which the supply and demand schedules for a security are in  
balance. See also bid price, last price, offer price and NBBO.

## carry cost

To understand the net return on a portfolio it is best to imagine  
creating it ex nihilo. To acquire assets it is then necessary to borrow,  
typically by borrowing \(shorting\) your home currency, or some other  
funding source. Although people do not always think about equity  
porfolios this way, it is actually a useful way to think about whether  
or not an investment really is worth making. It might sound good to hold  
a share portfolio for a year and show a total return of 10%, but if  
short term interest rates are running at 12% it suddenly doesn’t sound  
so smart any more.  
Because the Yen was, for so long, the currency with the cheapest carry  
cost, it became very common, and profitable, to put on a '`Yen carry    
trade`', which involves selling the Yen against \(for example\) the dollar.  
Because the long asset has the higher yield, this was a profitable  
trade. Clearly the danger is that the Yen goes up before the redemption  
date. This is exactly what simple arbitrage considerations would leave  
us to believe.

## mean reversion

Certain prices have mean reverting behaviour. Yields cannot go up, or  
down, forever. Reversing a trend, though, can take a long, and variable,  
time. I think that yields tend to mean revert, but it's not clear if equity prices do so.

## secular stagnation

The explanation of why gdp growth is so slow.

## MXEA

EAFE index \(Europe Australia and Far East\) future. Basically the developed world stocks that are outside the US and Canada. To get a whole-world exposure to developed markets, mix with SPX.

## Global Financial Crisis

The events of 2007 which caused such a dislocation to growth in most countries on the globe.  
Probably still the dominant policy headache for governments even today, eight years later.

## Mean Variance

This is the square of the standard deviation. It is the best simple single measure of risk of a security or of a portfolio. The variance of a portfolio is simply related to the variance of each component and all the covariances of the components.

## Execution Only

This, in the context of brokers, means an account where no advice is given. Traditionally, brokers would undertake research to give their clients ideas about how to trade. With so much excellent analysis available on the Internet for free, this is, increasingly,  
an outdated model. Even if a brokerage produces excellent research, of a standard which gives it monetary value, it is unlikely that the same brokerage would be the best for pure execution. Historically, broker commissions were fixed, so they competed on the quality of their research and other service. This, in the UK, came to an abrupt halt in 1986, the year of the 'Big Bang'.

## Black Swan

This is an event that you would expect 'never' to occur given the probability distribution baked into the models that are conventionally used to value derivatives that depend on knowing this distribution.

## Contract for Difference

Better known as a CFD, this is a straighforward derivative that gives a direct, geared exposure to a stock.
