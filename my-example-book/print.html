<p>I started writing this in 2016. I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect software to write it in. I tend to indulge in displacement activities. At least I have now settled on <a href="https://gitbook.com">gitbook</a> and so I can work on the content.</p>
<p>My main activity at the moment is giving a semi-running commentary on my investing. I am not sure that this will make very interesting reading, but it at least gives me some kind of narrative which I can use for investing.</p>
<p>I want to avoid this being just a book listing every possible type of security. Hopefully, I the various options will arise naturally as I explain my various trading ideas.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#for-the-technically-minded" id="for-the-technically-minded">For the technically minded</a></h2>
<p>The files for this book are kept as git repositories on gitbook, github and bitbucket. You can fork my source from the first two. I will probably delete from one fairly soon. Gitbook is a git server, so the easiest way to edit offline is to edit, git add, git commit and git push to gitbook. There are lots of links to gitbook attached to this book. Follow them if you are interested.</p>
<p>I started using markdown, then went to asciidoc. Unfortunately, asciidoc is just not as well supported, so I reverted to markdown, which wasted a bit of time. Markdown is pretty basic, but it's fairly intuitive, and lots of platforms and tools use it. Many editors have syntax colouring for it. I strongly recommend Typora as a markdown editor. It does a lot more than simply allow one to create stuff in markdown and covert it to HTML.</p>
<p>I've used latex format for the odd equation, and embedded them with katex. This is black magic to me, but it seems to work. The maths is not important. I just put it in to keep the nerds happy.</p>

<p>Many studies have shown that a chimp with a dartboard can construct a portfolio which outperforms the average the average fund manager. If you pay the chimp in bananas he'll virtually always outperform, after fees. Nevertheless, most ordinary savers choose to hand over their savings to a professional. This book is an attempt to allow you to make an informed decision about whether to accept the advice of your financial advisor at face value.</p>
<p>The key to a DIY approach to investing is an understanding of risk. There are two aspects of this. Minimising risk for a given return, and deciding on the correct tradeoff between risk and return for your own preferences. Saving is about trading current consumption for future consumption. Each of us has values our current consumption relative to our future consumption differently. Conventional economic theory argues that utility is derived only from consumption, but I actually think that we get utility from knowing that we have assets 'for a rainy day', i.e. current utility, as well as the utility we receive when we actually consume those assets, but I am straying into a territory where I have no expertise.</p>
<p>A lot of books about modern portfolio theory are very ... theoretical. They are full of probability distributions, efficient frontiers, correlations and covariances. I am going to steer well clear of this stuff. Stephen Hawkin once wrote that every equation in a book cuts its potential readship by half. I cannot afford more than a couple of equations before my potential readship shrinks just to my mother, so be reassured that I will avoid equations, or at least use them purely for decoration.</p>
<p>This book is written with the aim of allowing the do-it-yourself investor to compete on at least level terms with the professional. I am however keenly aware that most people will still prefer to leave it to a professional manager. In these cases, this book will allow a customer to make a fully informed choice of provider. There are many good financial advisors, and many know a great deal about investment. But they can face conflicts of interest, which can, in rare cases, lead to them giving less-than-optimal financial advice. Such investors are urged to read Chapter [XXX] carefully, and have the option of skipping Chapter [yyy].</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#about-me" id="about-me">About me</a></h2>
<p>I have worked in finance most of my life, and have been an active investor for the past couple of decades. I have made plenty of mistakes, and have learned from them. Although experience is (still) the best teacher, my goal is to make this book come a close second.</p>
<p>I want to write the book that I wish I had read when I started seriously investing in the mid 1990s.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#collaboration" id="collaboration">Collaboration</a></h2>
<p>Apart from finance, one of my passionate interests is technology. Recently a number of good, free ('as in beer') utilities have been developed to make collaborative writing much less painful than it once was. Several of them use the magnificent tool called Git. This is not the place to talk about Git. But it is wonderful.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to a economic and mathematical approach to securities and derivatives markets by Paul Roth, whom I met at Psion. I remain eternally grateful for that introduction.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for Tim Fletcher, formerly of Natwest Capital Markets, who opened my eyes to the pricing of interest rate swaps and other fixed income derivatives.</p>
<p>I've worked with lots of quants and programmers and traders over the years. I'm too lazy to list them all here, but I am grateful for the insights they imparted to me.</p>
<p>Many authors have helped me to the limited level of understanding that I've reached. Some are listed in the bibliography.</p>

<p>&quot;'Passive investing'&quot; sounds as though it is all about abdicating responsibility for investment decisions to another, presumably an &quot;'active investor'&quot;.

<p>'what is this?'</p>
<p>Although this book is about <em>active</em> investing, where the goal is to improve returns by a modicum of trading via an excecution-only broker, it is likely that most readers will read it for background information and continue to allow their savings to be managed by an agent.</p>
<p>All the principles of choosing assets continue to apply.</p>
<p>John Kay has produced a very good book about this sort of investing, and John Bogle has produced many.</p>

<p>don't abdicate responsibility for asset allocation. If you don't feel competent to make your own decision, at least resist the temptation to invest in the currently most fashionable market. At the very least do not put all your eggs in one basket, and that includes your own national stockmarket.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#types-of-orders" id="types-of-orders">Types of orders</a></h1>
<p>For liquid instruments like futures, there are a range of order types. The most important of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>limit orders: i.e. you offer to buy or sell at a specified price,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stop orders: i.e. you tell the exchange that you want to buy or sell when the securities price reaches a specified price. Of course, prices can 'gap' and go right through your stop price, so you are not guaranteed any particular 'fill'. In a fast market you may not even get an execution. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stop limit orders: your order is triggered like a stop, but if you can't execute at your limit or better you don't get filled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trailing stop: the exchange triggers a market order when the underlying has a price move of a certain size relative to a low or high.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases 'price' can be last trade, mid, bid or order.</p>
<p>There are many other variants and subtle combinations.</p>
<p>In some cases the broker will 'simulate' the order, if the exchange does not support the order type: i.e. the broker will (automatically) monitor the price feed from the exchange and trigger an order appropriately.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to put in some sort of closing order after establishing a position. Don't just buy and keep your fingers crossed.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#all-weather-portfolios" id="all-weather-portfolios">All Weather Portfolios</a></h1>
<p>The general idea of this is that timing the market is a mugs game, and that by choosing the appropriate mixture of asset types a portfolio can be constructed to withstand all types of 'weather'.<br />
The earliest idea was a mixture of domestic stocks and bonds (often in a 60:40 mix), but as other asset types have become more investable, this has been extended with new ingredients: TIPs, overseas equities, high yield bonds, commodities etc.</p>
<p>My own view is that at some point the long bull market in bonds is going to unravel and we are going to see a pickup of inflation that will progressively destroy bond returns. I believe that it is very important to remain calm in the face of losses, and resist the siren song to keep the faith in your original investment decisions.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#commodity-futures-etfs" id="commodity-futures-etfs">Commodity Futures ETFs</a></h2>
<p>These are ETFs that give investors an exposure to commodities without having to trade directly in the futures. Brokerages are reluctant, quite properly, to allow inexperienced investors to trade in futures because of the very high gearing that is possible using them. The ETFs have few assets under management by the standards of SPY and the big index-tracking funds. The strategies vary widely between funds, and are not at all transparent. The fees are high. The historical performance is poor. The sector is not popular, for these reasons.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#trading-strategies" id="trading-strategies">Trading Strategies</a></h2>
<p>An old boss of mine used to say ''There are no such thing as problems, only opportunities''. I was not convinced about this, but in investing this may well be true: for most assets it's easy to be on either side of the trade, so one man's loss really is another man's gain.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#inflation" id="inflation">Inflation</a></h2>
<p>Roger Bootle spotted that, early in the 80's, inflation would subside. This is a familiar, and unremarkable observation now, but at the time it  was fairly contentious. The upshot of this was a multi-decade long  'secular' bull market in bonds. Government bonds have given very strong  returns in recent decades, to the extent that the Cult of Equity has  died, or at is at least in the Intensive Care Unit.</p>
<p>This is all old news, and many people have got rich going long treasury bonds.   The question is, are we nearly there (at the end of the cycle) yet? Scott Sumner thinks  'probably not', on the grounds that US monetary policy is very tight still. He thinks that Eurozone policy may be even tighter.   This is based on the rate of growth of nominal GDP, which has been very slow since the Global Financial Crisis.  There is a long, honourable tradition of supporting nominal GDP targeting as the correct policy objective of a central bank.</p>
<p>I wrote the above a couple of years ago. Inflation remains weak. Even now, with a currency weakened by Brexit, inflation in the UK is still low, and gilts are recovering the levels they had at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Monetary easing continues to flow into asset prices, not prices of consumables. I suppose this is globalization. Who knew?</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#commodities-supercycle" id="commodities-supercycle">Commodities Supercycle</a></h2>
<p>The emergence of China as a sink for commodities of all kinds has resulted  in exceptional returns on all commodities up until the last few years. Because production of minerals has such long lags, generally, it seems likely that this  will continue.</p>
<p>To a certain extent current weakening (July 2015) is in part down to the US Dollar strengthening dollar-strength<br />
relative to emerging markets currencies.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#us-dollar-strength" id="us-dollar-strength">US Dollar Strength</a></h2>
<p>The USA has had the least slow recovery from the Global Financial Crisis of all the very large economies. It is a relatively closed economy, and the Fed is not terribly bothered about the exchange rate. This is not the case with the ECB, which is very concerned about Euro strength, which has been a big drag on the performance of Eurozone countries for a considerable time. They generally are much more open than the USA.</p>
<p>The argument is, then, that the dollar will soar.  For a pro-dollar article see <a href="http://on.ft.com/1LV5XXo">The world gears up for a surge in the US dollar</a>. My comments, and the article, were written nearly two years ago. The surge has not panned out, although the dollar has remained fairly strong.</p>

<p>Overall, had instinctive feeling that today was going down. Racheted up my exposure to $327.9K margin. Scary!</p>
<p>Mondays are odd, because the US markets don't get going until the US morning, so there are no live prices for ES in the morning. Your exposure to the far east via US derivatives (FXI puts) is considerable. This is likely to be a huge day for you. The question now is how to avoid getting crushed by the bounce. You have to unwind, but what do you trade??</p>
<p>The most amazing thing about the markets is that no new information has appeared in the last week or two. Coronavirus was known about in January. The overvaluation of US markets was known then. The likelihood that US interest rates would go to zero (like in Europe and Japan) was predicted months and months ago. The weak growth of the world economy (especially the US economy, whose notional real GDP growth was boosted by dubious hedonic adjustments to the GDP deflator). None of this really mattered until a dislocation in the market forced participants (now, probably, algorithms channeling human actors) to see the world from a different perspective.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#after-lunch" id="after-lunch">After lunch</a></h3>
<p>No point in trying to list sales. Basically, you unwound some of your exposure through straight short futures positions in Australia, Japan, Europe. After an initial phase in which circuit breakers halted trading, the ES market started to rise. You actually bought one ES future. </p>
<p>At one point you were up 20%, $197K. You could not realise this, no bids or offers in many long dated options positions. </p>
<p>This morning's (US time) action will condition the algos not to but the dip so enthusiastically in future. Whether I can replicate this performance again this month is debatable. Hopefully, the bull will be slain and we'll grind down for the rest of the year. Margin back to ~$250K in &gt;$1M. You still have a lot to make back.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#330pm" id="330pm">3:30pm</a></h3>
<p>Market recovering a bit. Bought a couple of ES, to blunt the impact. </p>
<p>Got short (via puts, looking for liquid ones) for MM, VZ, SBUX and BA. VZ because it seemed to have held up so well. </p>
<p>Lesson: good and bad stocks will be pulled down together because so much trading is via ETFs.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#wrap" id="wrap">Wrap</a></h3>
<p>One of the most extreme days in the market in recent history. Saudi, coronavirus, waking up. You were up 20%, which is good, but with many equities markets moving 7% this was not as good as it might have been. You kept your risk under control, and maintained your stops, so you were definitely more disciplined than you have been in the past.</p>

<p>Down 1.3% at the open, despite having taken a bracing position. Didn't want to go completely market neutral as I believe that this market has further to fall.</p>
<p>As of 09:15:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bought 1 DX by accident. Was trying put on a stop, but didn't change it from the default order type of limit, so it executed immediately. At least at market price. Worried that the USD will be 'unexpectedly' resilient because the Fed still keeps monetary policy too tight, relative to ECB,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BTP bought, stop triggered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SPI sold, price action, China exposure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SX7P, extended position. Thesis is that as US rates go down, ECB be forced to go more negative, which has bad impact on EU banks, which are already pretty weak,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UB fut. sold. UB spiked really, really high yesterday (&gt;240!) so this is a punt on the Fed triggering proper inflation. Don't know what this price is as a yield, but has to be way less than 2%!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAX sold, stop triggered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DX stopped out (earlier)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GE future (Eurodollar, not equity)) bought. Price is scarily high, but this is a direct bet on US rates going to zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:21: (I wrote and installed a python macro to insert a timestamp in Notepad++. Yay!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:22: losses shrink to 0.3% so I'm leaving off any trades for now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:29: P&amp;L goes green. You sell another UB and R future. Market is expecting stimulus. You are now using $30K of margin on your UB position. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11:00: decided to sell BTP. It has jumped a lot. Italy is still a mess. I am now up 1%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>17:31: wild ride in afternoon. Initially showed losses of $91K: about 10%. This went right down to $20K. It then shot up again. Stocks bounced a long way back from their lows yesterday. Probably I should have closed all positions, but I am sure we have not finished with the drop. Anyhow, nothing much I can do now apart from hold on until tomorrow. I am still up a lot over 2 days but it shows how much really violent moves can bounce the next day.</p>

<p>I was pretty busy today. I had to have my French conversation class at Maggie's house 
and I also went to the Club to listen to Partho Shome talk about taxation and India.</p>
<p>Looking at the opening and closing trades, it's not at all what I was trying to do. 
About half the trades were auto close outs. I seem to have taken on more risk, 
drunk on large profits largely generated from my high gamma RUT puts. 
Although I was up a lot, I did not remotely look like a disciplined trader.
A number of the single name puts were based on a gut instinct that stock which had not yet
fallen very much were doomed to go down. VZ, CPB fall into this category. 
I really know nothing about these names, and I may regret taking the position.</p>

<p>I like Bill Fleckenstein, because he makes a clear distinction between what he sees as the market over valuing or undervaluing an asset and what events might prompt him to actually establish a position. He is an active trader, and runs a fund, so it's always necessary to take account of the fact that he has a strong incentive to &quot;talk his book&quot; — i.e. argue the case for buying what he holds, so the price will go up.</p>

<p>In this game, one learns all about liquidity and opportunity costs. Now find that there are no out of the money puts to be bought for love nor money. Thank goodness I bought some on TSLA. I now feel so confident about making money on this stock ... well, by shorting it, anyhow. This is probably the time to wind down my position. The twin emotions of fear and greed facing me at this juncture, as always.</p>
<p>12:54 sold HG. 1 Fut.</p>

<p>Absolute mass of closeouts and trades.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#closes-1" id="closes-1">Closes:</a></h2>
<p>Big wins: TSLA puts, HYG puts, EMB puts, EWT puts, </p>
<p>Stops: ESTX50, UB.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#opens-1" id="opens-1">OPENS</a></h2>
<p>Basically, a list of futures, and shorting UB. Bought some more further out of the money puts. </p>
<p>It is now very difficult to buy out of the money puts on single name US stocks, country ETFs and euro sector indices.</p>
<p>It feels as though the market is gradually losing liquidity. Presumably, all the margin calls are in and there fewer and fewer forced sellers.</p>
<p>The good thing is that the hitting of limit orders on RUT and TSLA puts has dramatically reduced the margin req., down from ~$435K to now $358K. I did buy some more puts with the extra &quot;buying power&quot; generated but at some point the market is possibly going to spring back. SPX has lost around one third of its value from the ATH a month ago.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1919" id="1919">19:19</a></h2>
<p>Decided to buy some puts on LQD - investment grade ETF. Bonds are the next frontier. Govt. bonds still going up, high yield down. Where will high quality corp. credit go? Down, I'm guessing. Obviously.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wrap-1" id="wrap-1">Wrap</a></h2>
<p>Finished the day something like $280K up. A great day! 
This is the point of maximum danger. 
My good luck is lulling me into the delusion that I have perfect foresight. 
This will make me take more risks which will end up with me losing everything. 
God give me strength to resist temptation and not stray from the path of righteousness and tight risk controls.</p>

<p>Starting to be fearful of any continued (short) equity exposure. Markets have gone down 30+%. At some point they will bounce. Still short, and with loose stops because intra day fluctuations are large. 
Covid-19 is a severe headwind for the global economy.
The big worry now is that markets will be closed and the authorities will bring out the fiscal bazookas (or howitzers) just at a time where I am locked into unfavourable positions.</p>
<p>In recognition of the risks of fiscal action, I started to short some govvies. GBL and R. Not large positions.</p>
<p>As of 10:35 equities are down:</p>
<ul>
<li>DJ600 BY 2.5%</li>
<li>es 0.75%</li>
<li>FTMIB by 5.66%</li>
<li>HSI by 2.4%</li>
<li>RDXUSD by 4.3%</li>
<li>SX7P by 3.5%</li>
<li>TOPX by 1.7%</li>
</ul>
<p>(Actually, these were noted a while ago. There has been a bit of a bounce in the last half hour which cut your gains in half. 
Currently, you are up 0.8%: effectively a rounding error in today's stormy weather.)</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1107" id="1107">11:07</a></h2>
<p>Decided to put on a number of stop and limit orders to scale back risk in the face of further volatility. Generally, the futures had stop orders, the larger option positions had limit orders. Generally, the limit orders will show a healthy profit. The stops should contain the positions to modest losses. These were all trailing stops, so if the positions make further profits, these should be locked in.</p>

<p>Bought 10x DX! Have been seeing something about how USD is in high demand as people try to refinance their debt. Slightly spur of the moment. DX has been strong. Finally acted on the dollar milkshake theory. </p>
<p>Sold UBER shorts, to reduce exposure.</p>
<p>ES stopped, BTP, TOPX all triggered stops. Brutal upswing in equities, now showing $82K loss. In a classic example of making trading decisions according to frame of mind, rather than a system, I'd been reading some dire article on disease spread modelling by Neil Ferguson and others. Lots of things are closing down. Seems like the end of the world!!</p>
<p>You've made some money, but it seems clear that you are trading too much. Test now is to see if you can leave TWS well alone until tomorrow.
One bright spot is that your short bond positions are looking healthy: GBL and UB.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1650" id="1650">16:50</a></h2>

<p>On down days, the temptation to change one's mind is almost irresistible. It's like Odysseus stopping up his men's ears with wax and being bound to the mast of the ship. The Market Wizards interviews all have traders going on about how important it is to stick to 'a' system, almost irrespective of exactly what system. I guess the greatest sin is to change horses in mid-race.</p>

<p>Early indications (Twitter) suggested that equity markets were going to open down, so you sold ESTX50 &amp; NQ. UB was hit hard, and you sold an extra lot. UB is very long duration and very volatile, so it's uncomfortable. You sold BTP too, which seems a 'safe' bet (haha!).</p>
<p>TWS warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: DJ600, FTMIB, NQ, RDXUSD.</p>
<p>Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing GBL and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe GBL is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the UK has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. TBH, I'm grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up somewhere. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1140" id="1140">11:40</a></h2>
<p>DJ600 and FTMIB stopped out. Slight loss.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1503" id="1503">15:03</a></h2>
<p>US open was intersting. Stocks and bonds continue to fall. </p>
<p>Stopped out: NQ, JNK, NIO, VCLT, BTP. All bar the last at a profit. 
Trailing stops are working for you, even though you are typically putting a 2-3% range on them.</p>
<p>Purchased more puts on TSLA and MU. Both continue to sag.</p>
<p>GLRE closed out at a slight loss. 
Presumably worries about claims wipe out attractiveness of the fund management.</p>
<p>15:06: you are now up 11%. You have $1.1M 'excess liquidity' but that's still pretty dangerous at only 2x maintenance margin.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1539" id="1539">15:39</a></h2>
<p>Bought a bit of AEM (gold miner), AAPL puts (too expensive), BTP stopped out at a painful loss. Currently up 12.8%. Stimulus Phase 3 bill (billions for everyone) not having the desired pumping effect.</p>
<p>You are now running with a margin requirement of $600K. This is 2.5 times what it was a few weeks ago. You need to scale it back, even with your stops. It's very hard to cut back positions when seeing daily returns of 12% though. Fear and greed, bears and bulls fight out for supremacy.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#1813" id="1813">18:13</a></h2>
<p>(Hopefully, my last batch of trades for the day.)</p>
<p>GC stopped out: biggish loss, all commodities are being dragged down by the dash for cash, including gold. 
Same for FTMIB: can't get this right. Every other stock index future is crashing.</p>
<p>In spite of wanting to pare back risk, in fact greed got the better of me and I increased risk in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Puts on FXI, BA, TSLA, CHWY, CLX (last because it is the only stock going up!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CFD on AEM: gold miner that has been hammered. Small position only.</p>
</li>

<p>UB bouncing around a bit. 
Not clear in which direction. 
JPM put out dire predictions of Depression scale collapse in demand, but mind boggling sums being printed by the Fed are being announced every day. UB seems risk (vs 10 year) but my view is that these programmes are easy to start and hard to stop so in the long run we are (surely) going to see inflation win the tug of war.</p>
<p>DX has no clear direction after sudden bounce. I have heard various commentators making the point that there is a scramble for dollars, but I do not entirely see how this translates into a stronger dollar. The Fed is creating a tsunami of dollars, and has unlimited power to create more so how can the strength continue? Anyway, for the moment, I'm holding on for dear life.</p>
<p>SX7P, Euro Banks Index, has steadied. I am a long term bear, but I can see that the announcements of CBs everywhere will support the banks. My only positions now are through options, with no stops, so I am in for the long(ish) term. Most of my SX7P options are 92 days maturity.</p>
<p>Generally, it may be that we've hit a support level, if not absolute bottom, in equities and I should let stops and the positive gamma of my long options positions naturally scale back my short equity position. Maint. margin now is a scary $0.75M, even after the overnight stops. I must not extend any of my short positions, no matter how tempted I am! </p>
<p>Sold 1 Fut, ZAR. Emerging markets are going to be hammered when the developed world goes into recession.</p>
<p>12:01: short ZN fut position closed, as recession worries push down long rates. UB is rallying strongly, but stops not triggered. Short govt. bond futures should be negatively correlated with short equity positions, but in these extreme situations, all correlations go to +1.</p>
<p>12:09: well, I held off ramping up until now. I just sold 1 NIY fut, which is pretty chunky. Can't see equities rallying much today. Total maintenance margin is now $745K.</p>
<p>14:11: Fraud boy, fElon Musk is up to his tricks again. He has promised to build ventilators for the coronavirus outbreak and the algos have pumped the stock. I am eternally amazed at his ability to do this time and time again, even though he <em>never</em> delivers. I was so angered by this I bought 5 more oom puts. The stock is up something like 13%. Dumb algos!</p>
<p>15:14: you dropped by about 1.5%. UB and TSLA biggest contributions. Oddly, ES is down while TSLA is up.</p>
<p>15:26: Closed the trading app. Losses fluctuating, market directionless, rumours abounding. I need to get stuff done!</p>

<p>Markets were very, very volatile today. 
You were down a lot, and a lot of short positions closed by stop.
However, the ES closed down by 4.5% (maybe), so it looks as though the bear 
is still in the ascendant and that today (and yesterday) really was a bear market rally.
Of course nothing is certain, and IB has now really cranked up margin requirements
on open positions, which means that even though my shorts look modest
my maintenance margin amount looks humongous. </p>
<p>At some point there are going to be some very great bargains to be had,
but maybe not yet, and maybe not for another quarter or two.</p>

<p>This was a disasterous year. After the Christmas Eve massacre the markets, particularly the equities markets, rallied all year. 
You were impatient to win back your losses and ended up multiplying them. 
This was a valuable, but fantastically expensive, lesson in why you have to be patient and you can make money by shorting in a bull market.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#2018-and-lessons-i-learned" id="2018-and-lessons-i-learned">2018 and lessons I learned</a></h1>
<p>2018 was a brutal year for me. I've been trading for many decades, with moderate success. 
I feel that I had got to the point that understood a lot about macro and how it interacted with markets. 
Unfortunately, there is a big difference between investing and trading, and I failed to understand this.
Trading requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>never leave an open position without a stop-loss order </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do not assume that recent (low) volatility is any guide to future (high) volatility. 
The underpinning idea that securities have a forward price probability distribution which is approximately constant is false.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by all means have your convictions, but if the market moves against you, find some others! 
However correct your analysis, in the short term you can lose a lot of money, and the short term can continue for a very long time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>treat all positions as having the potential to kill you. 
Familiarity breeds complacency and unintended excess gearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do not assume that your broker's calculation of how much margin you have to post is a good measure of your risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remember that markets take the stairs up and the elevator (with a frayed cable) down.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#april" id="april">April</a></h2>
<p>Current portfolio, after minor tweaking this morning is as follows:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fixed-income-1" id="fixed-income-1">Fixed Income</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>GBL, BTP - Euro govt. bonds</li>
<li>JGB - Jap govt. bonds</li>
<li>R - gilts</li>
</ul>
<p>My general bearish view on bonds, especially UK bonds, the complement of my bearish view on sterling.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#equity-indexes" id="equity-indexes">Equity Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Short US equities, via ES.</p>
<p>Long EU equities, via DJ600.</p>
<p>Generally neutral on equities, but with a view that the US is leading, and the EU is lagging in the economic recovery, but will get there in the end.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#equities-1" id="equities-1">Equities</a></h3>
<p>BBY - some company-specific news that suggests that some of BBY's dire troubles are behind it. A major force in UK infrastructure construction, so should have a good demand outlook.</p>
<p>GLEN - has had a near-death experience, followed by a strong recovery. A high-risk company, run by a risk-taker, but in a bombed out sector, which surely is coming back. Also denominated in GBP, but really an international operation, that will benefit from the weakness of sterling.</p>
<p>POG - a play on gold, on Russia, and on the weakness of sterling. Really, too illiquid, and I'm unwinding the position. It did show a large loss. Probably worth having a continued modest exposure, but I won't be averaging down quite so aggressively in the future.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#commodities-1" id="commodities-1">Commodities</a></h3>
<p>HG - this is a bet on the global economy, especially emerging markets, recovering. Copper has been very weak, but it has so many uses in the modern economy, and is not exposed to any particular geographical source of demand, I feel that it should not be so weak.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fx" id="fx">FX</a></h3>
<p>Long EUR.USD - bullish on EUR, because EU following USA out of recession, but this not priced into equities or FX yet.</p>
<p>Long EUR.GBP - bullish on EUR, bearish on GBP, because of Britain's chronic twin deficits.</p>
<p>Short GBP.USD - bearish on GBP, as above. USD has strengthened, but will generally strengthen if the global economy grows, presumably(!).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#4th-april" id="4th-april">4th April</a></h3>
<p>We seem to be in a risk on world. Problems of the US president seem still to be setting the tone for the market. A bomb in St Petersburg yesterday didn't help, although the Russians never seem to make such a big thing about this as we do. I guess all news organizations pay more attention to domestic terrorism than overseas stuff.</p>
<p>The good thing about this is that POG continues to soar. As of this morning, I unwound my whole position, at a modest profit. It seems to be still going up, but now it has an RSI of about 90, I feel that discretion is the better part. It's pretty agonizing to see a security continue going up when you've closed the position, and there is always that temptation to get back in, since it's obviously such a good stock, but discipline is needed in this game.</p>
<p>My short government bond positions all tend to move in lockstep when something bad happens, which can be quite uncomfortable. To take some of the edge off a bond rally, I slightly increased my short S&amp;P 500 position. I read today that speculators are short Russell 2000 futures to an unusual degree, which, I guess, should encourage me. The short equity position is far too small, though, to go very far in offsetting the cost of a rising bond. There is no logic to all this, unless you assume some sort of global conspiracy. [Mohammed el-Erian]([https://www.ft.com/content/ebd96b1c-178f-11e7-9c35-0dd2cb31823a](https://www.ft.com/content/ebd96b1c-178f-11e7-9c35-0dd2cb31823a%29%29 thinks that yields will have to rise %28_Bond market ignores more assertive Fed at its peril_).  I am pretty well hedged, and although today is a risk off day, I am showing a profit, although I think my initial profits yesterday were wiped out by the bad news.</p>
<p>Macro news about Spain's unemployment being the lowest for eight years seems to have been ignored completely.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#6th-april" id="6th-april">6th April</a></h2>
<p>I always keep a few limits in place, at least on my positions I don't have total conviction in. I was short ES on the basis that this would reduce the volatility on my short bond positions. This is the equivalent of being long bonds and long equities in an attempt to diversify risk a bit. However, I am always nervous about shorting the US stock market, even at elevated levels, as it is such an attractive investment for anyone wanting to get an exposure to the global economy. I don't know exactly the figure, but US listed companies now must account for 80% those with a truly global reach, which probably means 80% of companies which are true global monopolies: where there are increasing returns to scale even at the a level of production which is the total level of global consumption. This is particularly so with pure internet plays, where the marginal cost of production stays at zero at any production level. There is no point where selling another copy of Microsoft Word starts to cost Microsoft more on a unit cost basis.</p>
<p>As you should know, I am fairly bullish on the global economy, and had long CL and HG positions. Both commodities have rallied quite a bit of late, and I decided to liquidate these. I always struggle with liquidating a position that is coming into profit. I know that autocorrelation is weak to non-existent in securities prices, so the fact that something has rallied a fair bit lately does not, ultimately, mean that it will not keep doing so.</p>
<p>I decided to liquidate my DJ600 positions too, since it was showing a profit, and once I'd liquidated my ES position, I was no longer naturally hedged against equity volatility. Selling this dropped my margin levels to around 11% of my net equity, and my VaR to about 8% of my equity. This is back to a comfortable level. Equity holdings really are expensive in terms of risk. I feel I can now sleep much more peacefully in my bed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#12th-april" id="12th-april">12th April</a></h2>
<p>Now I am down to just bonds and currency, things have got a lot less volatile, which is definitely a good thing. The bad thing though is that perceived instability in the world (Putin, Zuma, Trump) together with the continued rise of the anti-globalists (Mélenchon, Le Pen, Wilders), continue to boost the price of bonds. Actually, things have been very flat, but the period of sagging bond prices seems to be over for a while.</p>
<p>FX positions are largely unchanged. The pound has had an implausible rally against the dollar. This is probably more a generalized weakness of the dollar caused by the idea that Trump is going to be able to achieve a lot less than he rashly promised.</p>
<p>I have a wholly unjustified idea that price movements before a major public holiday (Easter) can be a guide to how the 'smart money' is positioned. The idea is that prop traders don't want to have to scramble to make margin calls when they are relaxing in the Hamptons, so gradually ease their foot off the gas pedal as they go into the holiday, which tends to make prices move against the, even if only slightly. I wonder if anyone has any evidence for this. It is not inconsistent with the 'Sell in May, and go away' aphorism which has been current in the UK for a long time.</p>
<p>If my idea is right, then I should see my positions bounce in value as soon as these masters of the universe return from their vacations.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#25th-april" id="25th-april">25th April</a></h2>
<p>It's a longer time since my last report. I tend to go quiet when I'm not doing so well. There was a risk off couple of weeks in which everything seemed to be going wrong. Trump seems to be at war with his team, and unable to get his way on domestic issues. He launched a big bomb against targets in Afghanistan, failed to get Obamacare repealed, is now facing a federal government shutdown because Congress is refusing to set a budget while Kim Jong Un is threatening to test more nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Everyone got worried that Marine le Pen would come top in the French presidential elections first round. She in fact came second, and pollsters are predicting that Macron will now beat her comfortably. This has resulted in a risk on moment for EU markets. I took advantage of this by liquidating (again) my DJ600 holdings. The only equity exposure I have now is TOPX, held for reasons I am a bit hazy about, but not liquidated yet since over the whole of April so far it has shown very strong upwards momentum. I recall reading somewhere that Japanese stocks were good value. Toshiba is going through a near-death experience as a result of its decision, more than ten years ago, to buy the Westinghouse Electric Company. I would hope, by now, this is in the price.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#27th-april" id="27th-april">27th April</a></h2>
<p>There is mounting evidence of an economic recovery in Europe. Unemployment continues to fall, and profits seem to be on the rise. There is noise, but the direction of travel seems clear. Political worries continue to nag, but Macron seems certain to be elected in France, as does May in the UK.</p>
<p>My bond positions continue to improve, albeit very slowly. Continental bonds have done better than gilts, which are persistently strong. The election creates uncertainty, and I am resigned to hold my position until it is over. It now seems highly unlikely that Corbyn or Farron will make much of an impression on the electorate.</p>
<p>My big bet against GBP, equally vs. EUR and USD does not seem to be going too well. The UK economy is doing well, with strongly recovering corp tax receipts last year. Deficits continue to be large, but at least they do not seem to be getting worse. It seems to me still possible that Brexit negotiations can easily be blown off track, but the perceived risk of this seems to be declining. Currencies really are pretty risky things to trade. I am not quite sure how I came to such a conviction trade as this. Forex at least seems to move quite slowly over the longer term. I expect that if the tide turns in my favour I'll steadily reduce the position. The overall risk in the position is down compared to a week ago.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#2nd-may" id="2nd-may">2nd May</a></h2>
<p>Time heals many wounds. The bank holiday weekend has been mercifully free of nuclear missile launches, mass terrorist attacks,  surprise elections of fascist dictators. The chaos of recent weeks is still a memory, but not so fresh a memory.</p>
<p>Recent performance has been pretty mixed. There is a general, slow recovery in the sense that yields, particularly on European bonds, have been creeping back up. The news over the weekend that inflation and GDP growth in the US were both very subdued made me worry.</p>
<p>It's always dangerous to read Zero Hedge. I found the following reports particularly worrying: <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-01/citi-issues-alert-its-most-popular-index">Citi Issues An Alert On Its Most Popular Index</a> and various articles on undershooting inflation and growth targets in the USA. It is looking increasingly likely that the Fed will delay again a second rate increase. As someone said, the 2% target is really looking more and more like a ceiling.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#11th-may" id="11th-may">11th May</a></h2>
<p>The portfolio has finally crept over the year end threshold. Unrealized losses still approach 10% of the value, but the gloomy memory of very heavy losses is fading. There are a lot of articles being written about how eerily low the VIX is. One part of me thinks that having no equity exposure any longer, I should be relaxed. My fear is that an implosion of the equity market might just provoke a 'flight to safety' to gilts and bunds, notwithstanding the fact that gilts continue to be as unstable as a box of out of date gelignite.</p>
<p>The Euro is rising, as a delayed reaction to Macron's win (maybe). The pound is sagging. There is a BoE report due today, which (hopefully) will send it down even further.</p>
<p>There is a heavy swing from profit to loss on alternating days. I have traded around this a bit, but it is very difficult to discern a trend in a very noisy environment. Risk is still a bit high, with margin around 15% of equity. I am waiting to roll off some of the gilt position.</p>
<p>There was a big move today. At one point my position was up by 2%, which suggests huge volatility. Within an hour it was back to up only half that. Bond prices seem particularly volatile. When they were down, I closed out my Bund positions, and eased off my FX positions, so my margin requirement is not more or less exactly one eighth of my capital, which I am comfortable with. There was a time when I would accept much more risk, but with a possible 2% move on one day, a margin requirements at Interactive Brokers seem fairly light. I just never want to experience having my positions closed out by my broker again.</p>

<li>-26% long-dated US Treasuries (ZB)</li>

<p>In terms of currency exposure, taking into account all the instruments above, plus FX positions, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>14% EUR</li>
<li>86% USD</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea is that the US is still on a recovery track, and will be the first economy to tighten rates, with Europe behind. I have roughly zeroed my exposure to GBP, because it is still far from clear what the future has in store for Brexit. Exposures should be taken with a pinch of sand because, for example, a UK CFD presumably is counted as a GBP exposure, even if it is a gold miner based in Russia.</p>

<p>The problem child of my portfolio is definitely POG. Gold is suffering from US tightening and a strengthening dollar, and this is pushing down POG, which seems to produced gold at around $1,200 an ounce.

<p>EFA and DJ600 are making un-showy progress. EFA is probably the better, more broadly based index, but I have a soft spot for DJ600, because it must be the equity index future with the largest number of underlying securities (and so, arguably, diversification).</p>
<p>Brexit uncertainty and government budget chaos have weakened the pound, but European new surrounding the increasing chances that Le Pen and Wilders will get close to power in France and Holland are, presumably, not helping the Euro. I have moved some of the exposure from USD to EUR, since Trump appears to be increasingly unstable.</p>
<p>Another tick up in US rates is looking more and more certain, so my ZB position has been doing OK. This might all go pear shaped if Turkey has a violent revolution, or Kim Jong Un lands a missile on Seoul.</p>
<p>I failed to resist the urge to have a little punt on oil. I bought two lots of WTI crude (ticker CL) on the basis that dropping $5 a barrel over the three or four days, with the general economic news being so strong meant that the contract was oversold. The RSI indicator has dropped to 18. I am not really a believer, but this just seems to be too good to resist. Famous last words.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#march-31" id="march-31">March 31</a></h2>
<p>There have been a few grim days in this month. Britain finally triggered Article 50, starting the process of exiting the EU, and Donald Trump failed in his bid to get the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, repealed. There was a terrorist attack, admittedly fairly inefficient, at the House of Commons, resulting in the death of one policeman and a number of innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>On the markets, there seems still to be a tug of war between producers and consumers of oil. Saudi Arabia is about to IPO Aramco, and is therefore trying to push up the price of oil. Russia seems to be helping OPEC in a rather desultory fashion, although seems to have stablized its own finances, at a level of almost unbearable poverty for what should be a developed northern european country.</p>
<p>The markets seem to be stuck in a marking time cum risk off attitude. </p>
<p>My positioning continues to be short sterling, long EUR, short interest rates for USD, EUR and GBP.
The risk off atmosphere has not helped. POG is still a slight problem child, but it has benefitted from a weaker USD and the risk aversion, to the point that I've managed to reduce my exposure by about half.</p>
<p>Copper has been bouncing around. I have slightly increased my exposure. For some reason I screwed up a futures roll, and ended up with a doubled exposure for a bit. By being patient, I managed to exit the over exposure at a small profit, but HG remains far from being a conviction buy. I don't really understand the supply dynamics. I think the demand side should be good, because electric motors are replacing internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>I am holding onto my EFA position, which is about the only one that's showing some consistent performance. I added a european exposure, via DJ600.  I have some GLEN, LAND, and BBY. None are doing too well.

<p>The fiasco of the abandoned repeal of the ACA, plus the surge in Sterling, occasioned by the serving of Article 50 without the world coming to an end, are hurting me, but not excessively. There have been a few times when the portfolio has dipped by 2% in a day, but generally it has gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Trumpflation seems to be taking a long time to arrive. There are still horrible levels of unemployment in the EU. Although the UK has nominally very low unemployment, I have no real doubt that the country could produce a great deal more without needing to have a lot of immigration, or, really, any immigration at all. Dream on, Steve!</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#armageddon-out-of-here" id="armageddon-out-of-here">Armageddon out of here</a></h2>
<p>February started with continued, strong headwinds. Not only were stocks battered, but my supposedly hedged interest rate strategy was coming apart.</p>
<p>The 'Japanification theory of Europe' started to get a hold, and Bunds seemed to go up remorelessly, in spite of record low yields. Eventually I capitulated and unwound the position.</p>
<p>The rag bag of short and long US stock positions were largely unwound too. Partly I liquidated the shorts too early, so that the falls on the longs eliminated all the profits taken on the shorts.</p>
<p>As of the second week of Feb, the markets have bounced off their lows, and I'm trying to be disciplined, and not get suckered into trying to surf the wave.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#january-2016" id="january-2016">January 2016</a></h1>
<p>The first days of January were a body blow to me as an investor.
In late 2015 I had read a large number of articles predicting the course of 2016, but none of them came close to describing the carnage that the slowdown in China would wreak on developed market equities.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the cause of all this is.
Circuit breakers fired when stocks fell by 7% in Shanghai.
New regulations prohibiting institutional investors from shorting stocks seemed to be part of the cause.
Sagging prices of commodities convinced everyone that forecasts of good global growth were illusory, in spite of good figures coming out of the US.
My view, for what it is worth, is that downward price pressure is at least as much caused by increased supply as decreased demand, but it really is hard to prove.
Certainly Iran being able to sell, Saudi desperate to increase government revenues, and even the Lybians managing to get some oil to market all boosted supply.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time on Seeking Alpha trying to find some ludicrously overvalued equities to offset my heavily long index exposure.
I found a few, but making money by a genuine Alfred Jones hedge equity strategy is very hard work.
I am writing this on 10 Jan, which is the first day that markets have rallied a bit.
Probably too late in the day, I decided to buy some protection against further falls in oil prices.
The market seems to behave as if oil prices are a barometer of world demand, as copper used to be.
My short position in CL has helped to protect me against fairly weak performance today.</p>
<p>My long Treasury Notes/short Bunds has not been outstanding, but at least my hedged exposure to global interest rates has been better than it might have been had I just shorted Bunds.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#10-jan" id="10-jan">10 Jan</a></h2>
<p>I have shorted CL and gone short CNH.HKD.</p>
<p>Rationale: hints of weak global economic growth reverberate in the price of oil.</p>
<p>China seems to be heading for the ''China Syndrome'' which suggests to me that the authorities will be left with no option but to weaken the currency to galvanize the export sector back to life. The fact that it will store up problems for the future is not my worry, for now.</p>
<p>I had not realized that the only currency pairs that are tradeable on IB for CNH are against JPY and HKD. I guess HKD makes a lot of sense, as there is a lot of HKD CNH trade, and yet HKD is fixed (via a currency board) against CNH.</p>
<p>Of course the potential fly in the ointment is that PRC changes the rules of the currency board, but I'll take a chance, at least to the extent of my modest current currency pair exposure.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#end-jan" id="end-jan">End Jan</a></h2>
<p>The decision to short CL was fully justified. The equity market, behaving as irrationally as ever, was falling as crude was falling. The justification (<em>post hoc</em>) was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the fall in the price of crude was the result of a fall in demand.
There was a downward shift in the demand curve, and so the point at which supply matched demand slid to a lower price.</li>
<li>the deficits created in the oil exporting countries would result in distress sales of the equities held in sovereign wealth portfolios, putting further downward pressure on prices,</li>
<li>the major oil companies would be hit with a lower priced product and increased production costs because of their operational gearing, resulting in reduce profit expectations,</li>
<li>the shale gas producers, which had funded their operations largely with high yield debt would not not be able to repay it, resulting in a collapse in this market, which would push up equity risk premia, again pushing stock prices down.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not convinced, but I decided that I couldn't ignore the correlation and built up a substantial short crude position.</p>
<p>Volatility in crude, and in major stock indexes was very high in the second half of jan. By the end of the month I had closed this position, but was hanging on to my MXEA, ESTX50, DJ600 and TOPX positions.</p>
<p>I ran small positions in a number of individual US companies, with fairly mixed results.</p>
<p>I had further pain from my long ZN/Short GBL positions. I thought that I'd try to cheapen the pain of this by selling a pair of options (call ZN, put GBL) to get some premium income without fundamentally altering the position.</p>
<p>The results were not pretty. There is no futures options market with GBL as an underlying, so I ended up having just one leg: a short ZN call position. As ZN appreciated (alongside GBL) I lost money on this position without the compensation of a short put on GBL.</p>
<p>Again, with yields in Europe getting even more negative, GBL did very well, exacerbating my losses on major european indexes.</p>
<p>Italy was very badly hit. Some report saying that the banking sector was rickety.
It does seem that France and Italy are incapable of reform, because of their political system. Italy certainly has huge problems because it still hasn't solved the divergence problems of its north and south from a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>My TOPX position has been badly affected by sagging Abenomics. New, negative interest rates were announced in Tokyo a few days ago, but it would be a brave pundit who asserted confidently that 'this time really is different'.</p>
<p>The whole of January was very difficult for anyone investing in equities. In times like these, my experience is that it is a big mistake to try to change course. I therefore rode out the rest of the month, largely without making any changes to my positions whatsoever.</p>
<p>Fairly to be market neutral with respect to global equities was a big mistake. My earlier strategy of long Europe/short North America would have performed splendidly. The problem with that sort of strategy is the cost in terms of margin utilization. DTB and CME/CBOE need to get their acts together.</p>

<p>The market seems fixated on the weakness of the Chinese economy, and, by
extension that of the rest of the planet. Many Chinese stocks have gone
limit down. I have tentatively bought one lot of XINA50, since a 9.3%
decline in a day is surely excessive. I have also increased my exposure
to ACWI by 2.5%. The only stocks that have withstood the onslaught are
CIU and VNQ. I am showing losses on my short positions in GBL and ZN
(and, to a lesser extent, R), but, interestingly BTP is showing a small
decline, offering me minuscule gains on my short BTP position.</p>
<p>The BTP effect shows that credit concerns for Italy slighly overwhelms
the effect of inflation expectations. I pruned the position by one
contract.</p>
<p>HG and HSI are being slaughtered, both on Chinese weakness. Transports
(DTX) is not doing so badly. This seems a very odd market reaction given
the relatively strong employment numbers at the end of last week.</p>
<p>I was down 1% on the day, which shows that I was not very well hedged
against equity movements. My overall exposure is 90% of my equity, so
it’s not surprising that my portfolio performed like this, with such a
broad sell-off in equities.
Equities have dropped by around three percent over the last week. I am holding on for a bounce tomorrow! ## Tuesday 28 July</p>

stocks as we (hopefully) emerge from stagnation. Shorting IBB is
certainly a way to hedge the overall long equity exposure. Growth stocks
have been so strong since 2008 I am reluctant to go too far.</p>
<p>I closed out my XINA50 position. China is a very foreign country, and I
just don’t have the resources to tell if it is fairly valued, or, if
that question is meaningful in a market that is so rigged by the
authorities.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be waiting for the Fed Meeting to take place today and
tomorrow. I assume there is some kind of statement.</p>
<p>The euro has been very strong lately, but I feel that this is just mean
reversion after the dollar shot up in anticipation of a rate rise in the
Autumn.</p>
<p>image:SPX-snapshot.png[alt#&quot;S&amp;P500 since 2007&quot; Chart for the day.] At 16:30 UK time the portfolio is up 0.5%. This is a modest bounce from
the lows of yesterday, but it does not feel like the start of a bull
market. The modest short bond element of the portfolio (about 20%)
doesn’t help very much as it is amplifying the swings when the market
gets panicky. I need to reduce the US equity element, I think, as I’m
getting nervous about the dominance of growth stocks in the SP500.</p>

<p>Things are settling down nicely. Portfolio up 0.5% at 18:40. Fed statement on rates today. I don't know what was said, but it seems to have gone down well: SPX up 0.46%.</p>
<p>IBB is down 1.82%: beginners luck, but I have only a small (short) position, so I'll keep it.</p>
<p>ZN down 0.23%, consistent with Fed statement implying early rate rises. GBL, R also down (unsurprisingly) but to my great relief, BTP down. BTP has been moving against GBL, lately. It is a nice surprise to see it coming into line, although my position is now pretty small, so it doesn't mean much to me in pound terms. Seems that Fed announcement was not much of a shock, since DX barely moved.</p>
<p>---- ## Thursday 30 July At 11:20, Major indexes up, AAA bonds up. Dollar flat.</p>
<p>At 17:14, most equity indexes down, ACWI down 0.32%. Portfolio showing a decline of 2.3bp (0.023%). Basically a flat day. ESTX up .3%, so I'm glad a I bought one extra lot.</p>
<p>VaR now sitting at 6.2%. Acceptable, but would like to get it to 5% of portfolio value. The ACWI position now accounts for one third of the VaR.</p>
<p>Decided to close the IBB position. This strategy needs to be examined later, in more detail. ---- ## Friday 31 July</p>
<p>Finally my limit order to sell MXEA at 1872 was triggered. Unfortunately I'd sold one lot earlier, so I ended up with a one-lot short position. Not a lot of
damage was done, bit I should have adjused the limit order.
This released margin of about 0.5% of the portfolio value (and about 12.5% of the previous margin). I then extended the position by buying some ETFs. Mainly VTI,
which has a wonderfully low expense ratio, but also EFA, which is the ETF equivalent of MXEA.</p>
<p>I have now pushed the VaR expected maximum loss to 5% of the portfolio value, which is a comfortable level that could be increased to take advantage of a rebound from a major market
movement.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#monday-3-aug" id="monday-3-aug">Monday 3 Aug</a></h3>
<p>Europe was up a lot earlier this morning, and I just wondered whether I should get exposure via DJ600 (the full 600 stock future) rather than the STOXX 50.
In general my attitude is always ''the bigger the number of stocks in the index the better'', as long as I don't have to pay much for the privilege.</p>
<p>I also felt that having 100% GBP currency exposure was possibly bad. I therefore bought some USD. This reduced by margin exposure.</p>
<p>The market moved against me in the afternoon: ACWI down .18%, but I managed to reshuffle my exposure without realizing any losses.
Not sure what is driving the market down: EEM seems very weak, so maybe its yet more bad news coming out of China.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a class="header" href="#tuesday-4-august" id="tuesday-4-august">Tuesday 4 August</a></h3>
<p>Got cold feet yesterday and transmitted a couple of sell orders to reign back the position.
Because of the early rally in European equities I'd bought some MXEA, but this slumped later in the day.
To reduce the overall risk of the position I put in a sell order which was triggered this morning.
I also decided to undo my newly increased exposure to USD.
It's really not good practice to get cold feet within a day of trading, but fortunately I was able to reverse these trades at no cost.</p>
<p>Current max loss (VaR) standing at less than 4% of portfolio equity, which is as low as it has been for a long time.
The summer, and the general uncertainty around China, Greece, US employment, UK recovery, Abenomics and the Fed raising rates all make me want to reduce my exposure.
Current daily movements trending to around the 10bp level, which is really just noise.
To be fair, though, the markets are quite quiet too. ----</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#wednesday-5-aug" id="wednesday-5-aug">Wednesday 5 Aug</a></h3>
<p>Equity markets rose strongly early, for reasons which seem to be connected with a light private payrolls number.<br />
This is supposed to delay the point when the Fed will raise rates.
Bonds (GBL, R, ZN and BTP) were all down between about a half a percent and one percent.</p>
<p>Equities fell back later in the day.</p>
<p>I took the advantage to take profits on a couple of positions, lowering my VaR to the lowest it has been for months. The only equity futures position I have now is OBX, which I probably should never have bought: it seems to trade only ever couple of days.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a class="header" href="#weekending-8th-aug" id="weekending-8th-aug">Weekending 8th Aug</a></h3>
<p>The end of the week was pretty disappointing. The payroll numbers were pretty much as expected: 215K, but the market didn't like them.
It's not really clear whether the problem is that 'the market expects' interest rates to increase because of the strength of the economy, or the stock market to decline, because of the weakness of the economy.</p>
<p>Commodities are going through a 'nuclear winter' as Dividend Disco says. At some point, things will have to improve, and with that in mind I've opened up a small position in VDE.
As usual when the market is drifting lower, I could not resist picking up some favourite stocks at a cheap(er) price.
My main splurge was on ten contracts of ES, which is, in the new cautious trading regime, a big postion for me.
// Must adjust to express in pc of portfolio terms</p>
<h2>I was tempted to punt on TSLA, which I regard as a faintly ridiculous company. I shorted 6.2% of my position, which is, in retrospect, quite brave.
The position was closed out via a saved limit order at the open on Monday at a modest profit, but I really must stick to my guns and avoid individual stocks.</h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#monday-10-aug" id="monday-10-aug">Monday 10 Aug</a></h3>
<p>On Monday the market rallied.
I yielded to temptation again to put on some extra exposure to the equities market 'now that the bearish phase is finally over'.  Purchases of VNQ, AMLP, DJ600 Sept, REM, VDE and BRK B.</p>
<p>As the (US) morning wore on the day got better and better.</p>
<p>Currently I'm getting away with it. Total VaR loss still only 222K, so I haven't gone mad.
---- ### Tuesday 18 Aug</p>
<p>Well, the market has resolutely drifted sideways.</p>
<p>I am up on the week, but only by 0.5%, so I probably should have stayed out of the market.</p>
<p>I did the accounts for the pension fund, of which my brokerage account forms the bulk of the assets, and was pleased to find
that I'd made an (unrepeatable) 75% return (annualized, continuously compounded) over first half of the calendar year.
Although this information should have no influence on my investment decisions, it did tell me that a lot is possible to make
seriously strong returns when the market, globally is going sideways.</p>
<p>Ironically I cannot really remember how I did it. Checking the market every day, seeing a significant number of days when the
portfolio is down significantly means that you end up losing track of the performance overall.
For Q1 and Q2 this was particularly a problem as I was transferring all my holdings from Options Xpress to Interactive Brokers.
After using USD as a base currency for a while (because that was what I was used to with Options Xpress, where you don't
have a choice about what base currency to use) I switched to pounds, which is, after all, what all my costs are denominated in.
Because the numbers were similar I really missed the fact that I was up a lot, in USD.
I believe my main gains were obtained by having faith in Europe and using options a lot.</p>
<p>I am not running any options positions now because this requires more day-to-day monitoring of my positions than I have time for, and anyway, volatility is too low.
I was mainly shorting puts in order to express a bullish view and receive option premium.</p>
<p>I do feel that USD is the place to be at  the moment.
The consensus seems to be building that the Fed will indeed raise rates next month, which, presumably will at least ensure that the dollar is supported.</p>
<p>EEM has been a terrible investment. Even though it's only 2.2% of the portfolio I deeply regret opening it.</p>
<p>Trading ideas (not implemented): short MYR, short anything to do with China, short anything to do with Russia and Brazil. The BRICS have become the fragile five (or ten, or fifteen!).</p>
<p>I decided to short the RUB and CNH. Emerging market currencies have had a rough time recently, because of weakness in commodity prices. The yuan is a rigged market, so anything could happen, but now the PBOC have allowed it to devalue once, and claimed the reason is to let its level be more determined by market forces, it seems logicall that for all sorts of reasons it will sink.
China is a semi kleptocracy, and although it has made great economic gains recently as it adopts western
technology I do no think that it will ever transition to a first world country unless it becomes a democracy, which seems as unlikely an event as ever now.</p>
<p>Russia is rapidly becoming a failed state. It went straight from communist dictatorship to kleptocrat dictatorship, and will not exit that state without a major crisis. ----</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#october-15" id="october-15">October 15</a></h2>
<p>There are tentative signs that Europe's economy is starting to take off. Mario Draghi seems to have overcome the opposition from the Bundesbank to buy government bonds. Far from generating hyperinflation, however, interest rates in Europe, both short and long term, have never been lower. Most of the continent has negative short term rates, which, until it happened, was thought to be impossible.</p>
<p>The way to take advantage of this situation is to enter into a spread trade, selling Bunds, and buying US Treasuries.  The theory is that buy being net flat in ten-year exposure, the strategy will be immune from global interest rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>The theory worked well for most of a month, before yields in Germany fell even lower. This was pretty painful, and has damaged my recent performance, but I still consider that the strategy is sound, and will not be unwinding my position any time soon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, margin calculations do not give me full credit for the hedge as Bund futures trade on DTB and US Treasury futures trade on CME (or Globex). I am nowhere near using all my capital for margin, so that's not a major problem, but it is a bit annoying.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#november-2015" id="november-2015">November 2015</a></h1>
<p>I got cold feet and decided to move towards a more hedged equity position. I decided to short the US and go long Europe (in the form of the DJ600 and EST50). Unfortunately this was sortly after a major correction across the globe. So far the US, to which I am exposed via the S&amp;P 500 index, using mini-futures, symbol ES, has roared back, slightly making a mockery of the idea that I'd be fully hedged against a major move in global equities.</p>
<p>Altogether, these have not been a terribly happy month or two. One silver lining is that I decided that it'd be better that my cash was held in USD, rather than GBP. Mark Carney's recent caution about the timings of rate rises (week 1 or the month) has resulted in some gains on the FX front. This position was opened up for hedging, so I can't really take credit for it as a brilliant trading decision, but I won't send back the profits.</p>
<p>I have also been influenced by the research results of &lt;&lt;{{book.bibliography}}#star-capital, Star Capital&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I have been reading &lt;&lt;{{book.bibliography}}#spitznagel, Spitznagel&gt;&gt; and have, as a result, been spending modest amounts of money on out of the money puts. I would have liked to buy puts on the SPX, but to reduce my margin requirements I have been buying them on the STOXX 50 (ESTX50) instead.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#week-1" id="week-1">Week 1</a></h2>
<p>This was OK, except that my long ZN/ short GBL position continued to be a drag.
The position is probably a bit large, but it seems to me that the view is essentially correct, that Europe's economy will pick up a bit on the coat tails of the US's, and bond yields on the two continents will come into alignment.</p>
<p>So far, this has not proved to be the case.</p>
<p>Otherwise, equity markets seem to be recovering, so I am making money. Unfortunately because I am semi-hedged, with a net short position in US equities, the short SPY and short ES futures positions are dragging me down. ## Week 2</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#starting-9-november" id="starting-9-november">Starting 9 November.</a></h2>
<p>The markets got spooked by slightly bad trade data coming out of China. I took the opportunity of closing out some of my short equities positions. The day was fairly ugly.</p>
<p>Generally I don't trade on rumour, but I decided to go long Valeant (VRX). This has absolutely imploded, on the slightly sharp practice of selling through its captive pharmacist. I went long late in the evening (UK) on Monday. There is a conference call due tomorrow. This is definitely not my style, but I decided that it was worth a small punt.</p>
<p>My long dollar position has done well. Mark Carney, BoE governor seems to be putting off raising rates, which is having the effect of lowering the currency.</p>
<p>Because I am very negative about the government in South Africa, I shorted the ZAR. I did this in small size, because I suspect that the currency has already gone very low, but at least with Janet Yellen saying that she really will increase USD rates, this should add a margin of safety.</p>
<p>I also have had a feeling in my gut that eastern european equities are undervalued. I tried to trade the ATXDE future, as a proxy, but Interactive Brokers seems not to support trading it.</p>
<p>Although a country's stock market and its currency are not closely correlated, out of desperation I went long some zloty, via a Globex future, to get some exposure to Poland. Poland and Czech Republic seem markets to watch, but unfortunately there seem to be no active futures markets in these countries. I guess that I should be grateful that there is a functioning stock market in ex-Communist regimes. Poland has the WIG20 index, and it is a great source of mystery why some enterprising exchange (DTB?) hasn't introduced a future on it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#wednesday" id="wednesday">Wednesday</a></h3>
<p>The dollar has been strengthening, driving down the SPX and ZN, and driving down GBL, thus causing losses on my interest rate position.</p>
<p>My long europe, Japan equity positions have done well.</p>
<p>I have decided that it is too dangerous to stay long US equities so I've been gradually reducing my short SPY and ES positions. Even though this increases the risk of my position, it reduces my margin requirement. If ever there was an example of margin levels not reflecting risk this is it. US brokerages do not 'get' trading in the rest of the world!</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#weekend-14-nov" id="weekend-14-nov">Weekend 14 Nov</a></h3>
<p>The market has been slip sliding away towards the weekend on the basis of slightly weaker figures coming out of Europe, and nothing much of encouragement coming out of China.</p>
<p>The dollar has now found a level. Commodities continue to drift down, in spite of various contrarian pundits saying that the time has now come to invest in oil.</p>
<p>There are some fairly crazy valuations of IT startups going on. The creators of Minecraft and of Candy Crush Saga seem to be worth many billions of Euros. This seems incomprehensible to me, but my track record of making money by going short on these sorts of bubble companies is not so good. Having cast adrift the anchor of valuation based on profits or balance sheet assets, it's all too easy for investor mania to take a shareprice to a point where short sellers cannot bear the pain before the shooting star plummets to earth.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#week-3" id="week-3">Week 3</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#16th-nov" id="16th-nov">16th Nov</a></h3>
<p>It was widely expected that the shootings and suicide bombings in Paris on Friday night would precipitate a heavy fall in the CAC40 and across Europe. Comparisons were being made with the sort of drop the SP500 saw after '9-11'. I admit that being long Europe, and long CAC40 in particular, I was braced for the open on Monday and, I confess, lost some sleep over the sort of losses I would suffer. It did occur to me that the attacks, although deeply shocking and incomprehensible, would not materially damage the productive capacity of the French economy. Of course, if they affected demand, by changing the behaviour of the French, this would be a different matter, but my feeling was that the French were made of sterner stuff. After all, they did give us the word <em>sang-froid</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, after a shaky start, the market opened significantly up, and remained strong all day.
The pundits who had predicted a meltdown were proved comprehensively wrong.
It's probably dangerous to ignore the pundits entirely, but this was a dramatic demonstration of how wrong they can be about the impact of news on the market. There was not, as far as I can tell, any major piece of economics news that would have had a strong countervailing effect to the news of the terrorist attacks.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#17th-nov" id="17th-nov">17th Nov</a></h3>
<p>My general mean-reverting mindset lead me to assume that I'd see the euphoria of yesterday collapse somewhat, but that assumption was far too weakly held to actually try to change position, so I left everything be.</p>
<p>I had sold some short-dated at the money calls, against my futures position, as a way of earning some premium income. This didn't work out at all well. I might as well have sold the underlying, as the STX50 powered through the strike price leaving me with an effectively flat position. At least I still had DJ600, CAC40, FTMIB and IBEX positions to catch the resurgence of european equity markets.</p>
<p>My bond positions continued to be a drag. I cannot believe that GBL can keep going up vs ZN, especially given the exuberance of equity markets in Europe.
I will not liquidate and live in hope. It's at times like this that I'm glad I keep my maintenance margin a small fraction of my equity position.</p>
<p>Markets collapsed a little at the close because of a revelation that a bomb had nearly been exploded near a German football match. There is a lot of talk about war, and attacks on terrorists. This is not the sort of atmosphere were stockmarkets go up steadily.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#18th-nov" id="18th-nov">18th Nov</a></h3>
<p>Equity markets fell to earth again to day.
Some more terrorist-related news involving capturing of suspects in Paris.
Hopefully all this will be over.</p>
<p>GBL continues to go up. My nagging worry is that we are seeing the Japanification of Europe.
The people in charge do not strike me as having a deep grasp of how to provide the environment in which free enterprise can flourish.
Maybe it's all relative, and that they are not, in reality, much worse than the US politicians.
Certainly, watching the US presidential race get under way, it's not at all clear that things are so great there.</p>
<p>I contemplating selling some options covered with my existing GBL and ZN futures positions. These are, technically, futures options. Bond futures normally do not have a very easily computed underlying price, so the easiest underlying to use is the future itself. The ZN futures options are incredibly liquid, even in the depth of the US night. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#week-4" id="week-4">Week 4</a></h2>
<p>Tension in the Middle East continues to spook markets. On 24 Nov a Russian jet was shot down by Turkey, which caused Europe to swoon.</p>
<p>The dollar continues to strengthen, against emerging markets currencies anyway. This helps US long-term interest rates come into line with Euro ones, which helped me.</p>
<p>I have taken a largely hands-off approach to portfolio management, although I did reduce my dollar exposure to have dollar exposure of about 100% of my portfolio equity.</p>
<p>I decided to dip my feet in the waters of precious metals by buying a gold comex contract and a couple of copper contracts. There are a lot of articles floating around saying that both these metals have reached a floor. I don't really know about that, but gold, certainly, is likely to be negatively correlated with equities, at least when Russian planes are being shot out of the sky.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#thursday-26th" id="thursday-26th">Thursday 26th</a></h2>
<p>I have watched markets recover from the shock of the shooting down of a Russian plane. The US market has been fairly flat, but the European equity market has been strengthening as expectations build that ''super'' Mario Draghi will unleash some shock and awe to boost Europe next week. Of course this all boosts GBL, which I am short of, so my upside has been crimped.</p>
<p>In retrospect going long GBL/short ZN was a very bad trade from a short term perspective. I still think it is a good long term play, and I am holding my position.
However, if I had been more circumspect, and built up the position slower, I would have avoided some significant losses.
I think that GBL is showing a progressively lessening response from ECB stimulus talk, so I'm holding onto the position, as I said.
As the old saying goes: a long-term hold is short term play that went wrong.</p>
<p>Over the last few days early gains have partially faded away as the close of business in the US has approached (I don't really monitor prices in the European evening: I just am disappointed in the morning).
Today will be different, if only in that the US markets are closed for Thanksgiving.
Of course, there is always the possibility that Iran drops a nuclear bomb on Damascus to vapourized my gains.</p>
<p>My track record in making money in FX is truly dreadful.
FX rates are notoriously unpredictable, and subject to rumours of what central bankers are planning.
The CHF is an historically low-inflation, strong currency.
The Swiss National Bank (''SNB'' in the trade) has been making interest rates more and more negative. Something has got to give, but I'm prepared to put a bit of money on betting that the CHF has further to go down.
There is quite a bit of chatter about the CHF needing to go down more, as typified by http://news.forexlive.com/!/snbs-maechler-says-swiss-france-remains-overvalued-20151119[this post]. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#to-end-of-nov" id="to-end-of-nov">To end of Nov</a></h2>
<p>European stocks sank as Mario Draghi failed to exceed expectations on the next round of ECB QE. The the Fed raising rates racheted up the pain.
Oil dropped, which should have been good news for Europe, on news of Iran and even Libya starting to supply oil to the world market again, and after an OPEC meeting ended in disharmony. However, all assets sagged together, because of ECB QE concerns.</p>
<p>All in all, things went from bad to worse as November came to an end.     </p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#december" id="december">December</a></h1>
<p>This month was dire. My main exposure is to european stocks.
They continued to sag as concerns over the middle east, Paris bombings,
Daesh, Russian involvement in Syria, Fed tightening, continued disappointing news coming out of China, and weak commodities prices, especially oil and iron, continued to be a daily feature of the news.</p>
<p>I took the view that all this was temporary and I could afford to buy on the dips, but the dips kept on dipping, and I was beginning to feel that the ZeroHedge view of the world was absolutely correct.</p>
<p>I had just read a book <em>The Complete Investor</em> by Tren Griffin, about Charlie Munger, and his ideas about finding intrinsic value and nearly decided that I was doing it all wrong.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Fed's tightening, which is about to be announced on the 16th seemed to concentrate everyone's minds on about the 14th. The conclusion of the market, tentatively, is that everything is going to be alright.</p>
<p>I am not out of the woods, but prices have strengthened promisingly.</p>
<p>I also bought a chunk of Valeant, (VRX), which did pretty well, but I chicked out on the 15th and closed the position at a decent profit. If I notice it dipping again, I plan to sell.</p>
<p>My reading continues to be eclectic. I read through <em>The WSJ guide to the 50 Economic Indicators that Really Matter</em> by Simon Constable. This was quite an easy and interesting read. It is very handy to read it in conjunction with subscribing to the D Short <em>Advisor Perspectives</em> newsletter, which has graphs and discussions of most of the indicators that are covered.</p>
<p>In terms of investment performance, the main characteristic of the month was volatility. Major indices seem to swing around regularly by more than two percent, which is wildly unlikely for an index which has an annual volatility of around 20%.</p>
<p>Protecting against volatility by buying options has become almost prohibitively expensive, although I had to buy some deep out of the money puts on European equities, ''just in case''.</p>
<p>The Fed jump of interest rates seems to have spooked the US and international markets, without sending them in any particular direction. The USD has been quite strong against the GBP, so my hedging of this risk has paid off.</p>
<p>My conviction that at some point this divergency between US treasuries and Bunds will revert has yet to bear fruit, but at least over the last few weeks it hasn't got materially worse. I am in this trade for the long haul. I certainly didn't expect it to be as long as this.</p>
<p>Oil prices continues to plumb new depths. At some point they must hit a bottom, as must other commodities, but miners - and the FTSE - continue to suffer. It seems to me that either (i) oil will hit a bottom, start to rise (or even just remain flat), cause the start of inflation in Europe and my GBL/ZN trade will start to pay off or oil prices will continue to weaken, depressing inflation in Europe, which will spur the ECB to more QE and stimulus, which will boost my EU equities by enough to offset my GBL pain.</p>
<p>It remains baffling to me that stockmarkets rally when oil does. Maybe it's just a 'risk on' flow out of Treasuries which inflates all real assets, but for the vast majority of companies in Europe, oil is a cost. Even the UK, which is most heavily exposed to minerals, has only 5% of the stockmarket cap in miners and extractive industry. I feel I want to go short of oil, just to reduce the swings on my portfolio value, but I cannot bear to short something that has fallen so far, and so fast. Especially when the Middle East continues to look like its in the middle of WW3.</p>
<p>I am writing this on Dec 29. I am currently long DJ600 and ESTX50. Also exposure to individual large markets: Z, FTMIB, CAC40 and IBEX. I am long ZN and short GBL.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#trading" id="trading">Trading</a></h1>
<p>At one level, there is no secret to investing. You just buy things cheaply and wait. You wait for the rest of the world catch up with your valuation, so you can sell the things back. Or you wait and receive the income, which is more than you'd get from an expensive or correctly priced investment.</p>
<p>Of course the secret is to know what is cheap. Because this relies on your spotting something that nobody else has.</p>
<p>Value, as far as an investment is concerned, is a future cashflow, either as a payout from the issuer of the security, such as a dividend, or a bond coupon, or the proceeds of a sale. Depending on the nature of the issuer, and the nature of the security, these all are uncertain to some extent.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-golden-rule-buy-low-sell-high" id="the-golden-rule-buy-low-sell-high">The Golden Rule: buy low, sell high</a></h2>
<p>In its very basic form, you will buy shares in a company, ideally earn quarterly dividends, and then sell at a higher price than you paid at the start as the company is deemed by investors to be more valuable than when you started. The share price is a kind of consensus on that valuation, giving the approximate current price that shares are trading hands at.</p>
<p>This presumes that you have money to invest in the first place. Surprisingly, a mechanism called short-selling allows you to work around this limitation. It requires that someone lend you shares that you promise to return at a later time. You would do so if you believe that the price is due to drop soon. You sell the shares, buy the same number back when the price has duly dropped, and then give them back to the lender, pocketing the profit from money you did not have in the first place.</p>
<p>Short-selling also presumes that the lender is not expecting the shares to drop in value, or he might decide to sell them now to avoid a loss.</p>
<p>All investors worry about their exit: converting their paper gains to real assets. For the trader, the exit is the closing of his position, which converts his unrealized profit to a realized profit.</p>
<p>This rule works whether you buy first, or sell first. If you sell first, this is called short selling. It is particularly easy to do this with futures.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#short-selling" id="short-selling">Short selling.</a></h2>
<p>There is nothing mysterious about this.</p>
<p>A 'normal' trade involves handing over cash and receiving the shares. A short sale is just handing over the shares and receiving the cash. If you always start with nothing, you'd have to borrow the shares.</p>
<p>This means that you promise to pay back the cash at some point in the future. The converse also applies.</p>
<p>If you sell short, you promise to repay the shares at some point in the future.<br />
The economic effect is more easily and cheaply achieved by selling a CFD.</p>
<p>In the USA it is also possible to sell a single-stock future.<br />
For indexes, futures and ETFs are also available, and, because stock futures are cash settled you don't ever have to worry about having the stock available to borrow.</p>
<p>Borrowing stock is more difficult than borrowing money because ... well there are many more shares in issue than there are currencies.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#valuation" id="valuation">Valuation</a></h2>
<p>The key to investment is valuation. Making money is easy: find mispriced securities, buy them, and wait for the market to realize its mistake.<br />
Unfortunately there is an extremely well-tested academic theoryEMH that says that securities are never mispriced.</p>
<p>The EMH relates to securities. An equity market index is a weighted mean of a set of stock prices, so it is reasonable to assume that the index will be correctly priced. Lots of analysts and traders are comparing the values of individual stocks and shifting savings between them, so the</p>
<p>EMH at the stock level is likely to hold closely. I believe that it possible that it is possible to detect mispricing between the same asset classes between countries, and between different asset classes within a country.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#yield" id="yield">Yield</a></h2>
<p>Most financial assets produce some kind of income. Not all produce a long-term steady stream, but many do. The ratio of the unit-time income to the price of the asset is known as the yield redemption-yield</p>
<p>[redemption-yield]: when all future cash flows from an asset are known then a redemption yield can be calculated, which is the internal rate of return on the cashflows. This redemption yield can be calculated, only under the assumption of the absence of credit risk.</p>
<p>Shares produce dividends, and so a dividend yield can be calculated for a company, which is comparable to the yield on a bond. However, for most companies, for tax and other reasons, only part of the earnings are paid out, but that which is retained is &quot;really&quot; an addition to the shareholders’ funds, and so another, possibly better, measure of yield is <code>earnings yield', which is the ratio of earnings per share to share price. Going one step further one can define EBITDA, which converts the</code>earnings', which is an accounting concept, to an actual cash flow.</p>
<p>Short dated bills are sold at a discount, so the return is built into the `bullet' redemption when the bill matures. Some shares pay no dividends, especially younger companies that are still in a growth phase, and feel that their assets produce a bigger return on retained earnings than their cost of capital [check this! Check the WB argument about whether it’s right to buy back shares.]</p>
<p>How do you know the price is low if you don’t have a view on what it should be? The sorts of securities we will be selling will be widely held. Presumably most holders are very happy to hold on to their stock of securities (their holdings or position)</p>
<p>Each investor will have a value to him of</p>
<p>$$
\sum_{i} Exp(pv_i )
$$</p>
<p>where $$pv_i = c_i d_i and d_i = d(t_i)$$</p>
<p>and the expectation is formed over the probability distribution for</p>
<p>receiving $ c_i $ at time latexmath: $ t_i $ .</p>
<p>The problem therefore boils down to finding the distribution, $ p_i $ , and, to a lesser extend, the risk-free discount factor $ d(t) $. Because it is so difficult to estimate the distribution, an approximation is often made to just discount the cashflows at a larger discount factor that incorporates both a time element, and risk element, perhaps derived from the cashflows of similarly risky assets.</p>
<p>You may be relieved to read that these mathematical formulations are largely useless. This is because you are substituting one problem: establishing a correct price, for another: constructing a probability distribution.</p>
<p>Note that the discount factor for risk free cashflows reflects the individual investor’s time value of money. [In practice we ignore this: is this reasonable? If someone had a different time preference, would this really affect valuations?]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-securities-exchanges" id="the-importance-of-securities-exchanges">The importance of securities exchanges</a></h2>
<p>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of minimizing the cost of managing a portfolio.<br />
The spread between buying and selling is an important part of this cost.<br />
A stock exchange minimizes this spread by attracting to one place (or at least one platform) all the parties who wish to buy or sell.</p>
<p>If you keep trading to a minimum the spread, even for illiquid shares, should not represent a huge cost. However, futures, at least the most liquid stock index ones, have to be `rolled' every quarter.footnote:[Some futures, especially in the less developed markets need to be rolled every month.]</p>
<p>//// Korea is one, also some of the smaller european markets - Norweigen? Check!</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a tradeoff between getting the exposure you want and the spread you have to pay.<br />
You can get exposure to 600 stocks through the DJ600, compared to only 50 in the ESTX50.<br />
However the latter has lower spreads.<br />
It also has the advantage of being on an an underlying with an active options market.<br />
The other example is the MXEA which would have to be made up of a mixture of European, Japanese, Australian and XXX futures.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#stock-exchanges" id="stock-exchanges">Stock Exchanges</a></h2>
<p>// Deliver price visibility, and, sometimes, settlement services.</p>
<p>I don't discuss trading individual stocks, or bonds, so the main function of the exchange is to generate reliable prices for the components of equity indexes. For various reasons a lot of trading is moving away from exchanges, but for main market shares there should still be sufficient depth to the market to establish reliable prices.</p>
<p>//// Say something about Dark Pools</p>
<p>A marketplace, where buyers and sellers come together to assist price discovery. These days usually coming together in a strictly electronic sense.</p>
<p>Will usually collect bids and offers from participants. Sometimes with specialists, who enjoy certain privileges in exchange for providing liquidity.</p>
<p>Securities exchanges often work to reduce the delivery risk to buyers and sellers by providing some structured settlement system by ensuring transfer of title against payment. They will always attempt to standardize securities. Without standardizing contracts selling and buying become enormously more expensive. God gave us wheat, but the Chicago Board of Trade gave us No. 2 Soft Red Winter Wheat .</p>
<p>////<br />
In practice your broker will make all the decisions about where your trades are executed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#futures" id="futures">Futures</a></h2>
<p>The most basic derivative. Has existed for hundreds of years to meet the demand for farmers to remove risk of an adverse movement in grain prices. A farmer can sell his grain, to remove his risk of the price going down, and a baker can buy this grain, to remove the risk of the price going up. The contract specifies a standard of wheat, and a delivery date. The exchange removes the credit risk that would otherwise exist. Both parties have the exchange as their counter-party. By insisting on all parties providing collateral, the exchange can insulate itself from credit risk. By never entering into a one-sided deal, the exchange isolates itself from market risk.</p>
<p>Futures are generally used to take a strong directional view of an expected price movement. Given constant yield curve and dividend expectations, a future moves in tandem with the cash market, so if you have a view about the underlying market, you can cheaply express it by buying or selling the future. For most futures, the spread, and the liquidity, are excellent, as long as you stick to the nearby contract.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#options" id="options">Options</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of variations on a theme when it comes to options. You not only have options on cash securities, but also options on futures.<br />
With futures, there is usually just one liquid contract, the `near month'. With options, there is a whole two-dimensional space of expiries and strikes, but there will be next to no liquidity in most of this space, so it is important to check the market depth before risking any trading.</p>
<p>Even with the most liquid options, the bid-ask spread is much bigger, certainly as a percentage of the price, so you really don’t want to be opening and closing positions too rapidly.</p>
<p>I tend to trade options to execute a mean-reversion trade. When the market has gone up very rapidly, volatility is likely to be very high, for short-dated options. Writing an option to take advantage of a reversion can work here because even if the market just stays still, you’ll still make money as the option time value decays. Not everyone wants to take the risk that writing `naked' options implies. It is also expensive, in terms of margin usage.<br />
The great advantage of options is that you can protect yourself against so called Black Swan events.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#futures-options" id="futures-options">Futures Options</a></h2>
<p>In many cases the price of the underlying for a future is easily determined. In the case of bond futures, the underlying is one of a number of 'deliverable' bonds, one of which is the 'cheapest to deliver'. The underlying is then, in effect this bond, but which one it is can change from day to day, depending on the exact shape of the discount curve.</p>
<p>To solve the problems with a slighly blurry underling, it's easier to trade options on futures. These are slightly simpler to analyze theoretically, as both the option and the underlying have no carrying cost.</p>
<p>The great advantage of these as tradeable instruments is that if you get cold feet on the direct of the underlying, but already have a futures position, you can write a covered call or put, depending on whether you are long or short the future, to earn a bit of premium income.</p>
<p>When you write options, time is on your side, as if the market is going sideways, you make money. footnote:[This makes assumptions about interest rates and volatility remaining steady. In practice a market that is going sideways will nearly always one where volatility is flat or declining.]</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#brokers" id="brokers">Brokers</a></h2>
<p>Exchanges have systems that cannot be accessed directly by end investors. Diversification is important, and having good access to as many exchanges is necessary to get good diversification. Most brokers concentrate in one geographical area (e.g.UK or USA), or in one product area (like futures and options). Many struggle to develop systems which are truly multi-currency. Brokers are supposed to have protocols in place to minimize credit risk: you, as a trader, do not trade with them as a counterparty: they are your agent.</p>
<p>In the area of futures traders, there have been some spectacular failures: MF Global, and Saxo Spreads. Brokers tend to fail at a time of maximum market volatility: the very last time you want to try to change brokers, and take the risk of liquidating and re-establishing a position.</p>
<p>I have found that a good place to start is <a href="http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB51367578116875004693704580500193983582362%5BBarron%E2%80%99s">http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB51367578116875004693704580500193983582362[Barron’s</a> Survey of Online Brokerages]. I personally use Interactive Brokers. They are fairly sophisticated, and are the best that I’ve come across.<br />
Previously I was with Options Xpress, a very good brokerage, owned by Charles Schwab, but one that now focuses almost exclusively on clients based in the USA. My experience is that US-based brokerages are many years ahead of UK or European providers in terms of technology and breadth of product coverage.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#styles-of-investing-1" id="styles-of-investing-1">Styles of Investing</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#time-horizons" id="time-horizons">Time Horizons</a></h3>
<p>Some people make a keen distinction between speculating and investing.<br />
The general idea is that investing is finding the highest-quality assets and allocating capital to them for a long time. Warren Buffet’s holding period is, famously, <code>for ever'. Speculating is associated with short-term trading.</code>Day traders' (and most spot FX traders) will open positions after they arrive at work, and close them all out before they go home for the night. An individual will have a time horizon which is determined by the timescale over which he transitions from being a net saver to a net dissaver footnote:[It is not entirely clear to me that, if a fund is managed for a large pool of savers, the time horizon he should focus on should be some average of the economic situation of his investors.].</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#momentum" id="momentum">Momentum</a></h3>
<p>Momentum trading is exactly what it sounds. You wait until you see something go into a <code>bull market' and climb on the bandwagon, making sure that you jump off before it reverses and enters a</code>bear market'. The financial press routinely refers to bull and bear markets as if they self-evidently exist. But the EMH, for which the proposers were awarded a Nobel Prize, postulates that the sort of price behaviour which would give rise to a bull or a bear market simply does not exist.</p>
<p>If one looks at a price history of the S&amp;P 500 index since 2009 to today, it certainly doesn’t look as though it has followed a random walk. In his extensive analysis of investment strategies, XXX has concluded that momentum investing is the only one that produces sustained extraordinary risk-adjusted returns [Reference book on asset returns] .</p>
<p>My view on momentum investing is that by the time a bull market is established the valuation of the asset is too rich for me to want to invest. The S&amp;P500 is now at a very steep valuation, and to buy now is to risk being long when the market crashes. It is certainly the case that markets go up steadily and then crash precipitously.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#growth" id="growth">Growth</a></h2>
<p>Some industries, and companies, are likely to grow faster than others. Internet stocks are likely to grow quicker than steel manufacturers. Given that assets will flow to equalize the returns on the two types of stock, it follows that growth stocks will have a lower yield (dividend, and earnings) than the alternatives.</p>
<p>The growth style of investing tries to identify stocks with genuine growth prospects. This tends to be a popular investment style in a macro environment with strong economic growth.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#value" id="value">Value</a></h2>
<p>Value investing is associated with Ben Graham, ??? Dodd and Warren Buffett. This attempts to examine companies’ accounts closely to identify undervalued companies, especially those which are out of favour whose price has dropped below a 'fair' value. Buffett’s style also attempts to identify sustainable competitive advantage</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sector-rotation" id="sector-rotation">Sector rotation</a></h2>
<p>Sectors go in and out of fashion. Multiples theoretically reflect growth prospects, but growth is something that must come to an end. It is, in general, impossible to know whether a sector is cheap because it is despairately unfashionable, or because there genuinely are a lot of companies in it which are about to fold. It may be that both are applicable.</p>
<p>There is always something being written in Seeking Alpha about which sector is about to come back from the dead, but beware that these are usually written by fans of the sector.</p>
<p>It is generally the case that earnings are much less volatile than a stock price, and that yields are mean-reverting.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#technical-trading-and-mean-reversion" id="technical-trading-and-mean-reversion">Technical Trading and Mean Reversion</a></h2>
<p>Equity markets typically have an annual standard deviation of 20%. This is an annual variance of 4%. A typical daily variance, given there are roughly 200 trading days per year is therefore a typical daily SD is 1.4%, so once or twice a year you can expect to see moves of around 3%. This is a big move, the sort that leads to margin calls and heart attacks for holders of highly geared positions. It is also the sort of move that is likely to prove profitable for those who are confident enough that this does not signal the start of the next bull or bear market and have equity reserves remaining to extend or sustain a position to express this view.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental contradiction between mean reversion and the zero autocorrelation behaviour predicted by the EMH. As a non-trader, I believed that traders could not beat the market, but my practical experience of seeing large moves in the market leads me to believe that mean reversion is a fact of life at extremes of the market. I do not truly know the mechanism for this, but I think that it is something to do with forced closing of positions which are adversely affected by sudden large moves. A brokerage will close out a position when inadequate margin has been posted. Brokerages vary, but none are patient when it comes to waiting for margin calls to be met.</p>
<p>Mean reversion is a dangerous guide to trading. Markets can over-react to all sorts of news, and drift back after a decent interval. However, for some stocks there is no coming back. It seems unlikely that conventional retailers will come back from the existential threat that is Amazon. However, you'd look pretty stupid if you shorted Whole Foods the day before Amazon announced it was intending to take them over.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#macro-trading" id="macro-trading">Macro Trading</a></h2>
<p>Most investors depend on fund managers to make investment decisions for them. Most fund managers are concerned with a small sector of the universe of financial assets. Some will focus on UK large cap stocks, others on small cap, others on emerging markets debt, others on 'special situations' (takeovers and mergers), there are many flavours of debt funds. It is widely known that decisions about asset allocation are usually more important than decisions about individual securities, but these are often taken by default: either by the investor who selects a fund, often based on its recent performance, or marketing, or because a regulator has decreed that certain types of saving must be allocated to 'low risk' assets. This is particularly true of pension savings, which are the biggest source of investment [check this and give reference], where, increasingly, regulators require cashflows from the asset to match the liability. Because cashflows from equities are uncertain, relative to cashflows required to service annuities, this effectively drives savings into fixed-income products.</p>
<p>I believe that by holding a portfolio that has the potential to hold a very wide range of financial assets, it is possible to profit from correctly calling changes in the global economy. This requires an understanding of how different asset classes will react to unexpected changes in the wider economy, and an edge on other investors on predicting the evolution of how the global economy will evolve.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#turning-japanese" id="turning-japanese">Turning Japanese</a></h2>
<p>We live in oriental times. In 1992, because of bad lending to finance property purchases, Japanese banks were pushed to the brink. To avert a collapse of the Japanese economy, the government adopted extreme monetary stimulus, pushing 'risk free' rates down to approximately zero, encourage borrowing and capital investment, and, incidentally, prevent major failures of large banks. When reducing interest rates failed to have the desired effect, the government set about buying assets, particularly government bonds, as a way of continuing the war on stagnation by other means.</p>
<p>Something spookily similar happened in the West in 2008. It was widely expected that flooding the economy with high powered money would cause inflation, and growth, but, as in Japan sixteen years earlier, this didn’t happen. Instead the West joined Japan in a period of weak growth, and low inflation, and a continued bull market in risk free assets. What happens next is the most important question for traders.</p>
<p>Central bank governors in the USA have stated that interest rates are about to start rising. This did actually happen in Japan, but the impact on the economy was so bad that the policy was reversed, and the central bank returned to more 'unconventional' monetary policy, with the government deciding on various policies to boost demand and reduce the rigidity in the supply side of the economy. [Check what the 'three arrows' of Abenomics are: presumably monetary, supply-side reforms and ?foreign exchange policy]</p>
<p>Japan and the West have not followed exactly the same path. The Nikkei is still well below its peak in 1992, whereas the S&amp;P500 has more than tripled since 2009. Bond yields of developed countries throughout the world are hitting their lowest value ever. Strong corporate names can issue paper at unprecedently cheap rates, and have done so, often to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks, but rarely to invest in capital assets, which the possible exception of the Fracking Fraternity.</p>
<p>An investment strategy requires a view of the future. We can envisage (at least) three scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Growth in the world economy picks up smartly, productivity and</p>
<p>labour force participation increase, demand for commodities picks up and</p>
<p>we catch up with the trend growth that applied before 2008. 'Growth'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We hit stagflation: growth remains 'lacklustre' but the huge</p>
<p>quantities of (central bank) money that have been injected leads to</p>
<p>persistent, and possibly accelerating inflation. 'Stagflation'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continue in a low-growth, near-deflationary path indefinitely.</p>
<p>'Japan'</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems to me that one big issue to resolve is similarity of what we are going through now, to the situation in Japan around the late nineties. It has been suggested [reference?] that monetary policy in Japan was, and possibly still is, too tight, because the commercial banks inability, or unwillingness to lend.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#japan-scenario" id="japan-scenario">Japan Scenario</a></h2>
<p>As a general rule, we tend to overestimate the probability that things will not change, so the Japan scenario is one we should examine closely. It is not at all clear that the right investment decision in Japan in 1999 will be the right decision here, in the West, today. There was no bull market in equities in Japan up to this point. My tentative view is that, because inflation will remain subdued in this scenario, that fixed income will remain decent investment choice, especially coporate bonds, including sub-investment grade, but only from the strongest names.</p>
<p>Because government bonds have such low yields, for mean reversion reasons, it’s hard to justify putting them into a portfolio at all. Stagflation Scenario</p>
<p>Here we need to get out of bonds. Gold and real estate might do well.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-holding-your-nerve" id="the-importance-of-holding-your-nerve">The importance of holding your nerve</a></h2>
<p>There will come a time when you have been trading securities when an investment decision you have made will appear to go horribly wrong. Your position will show apparently inexorable mounting losses and you will lose faith. You will doubt your analysis, and become convinced that the factors that you previously disregarded that argued against this investment were, in fact, the dominant ones.</p>
<p>If at all possible, do not liquidate. And even more importantly, do not invert the position, going long where you were previously short. That way lies madness. Or at least big losses.</p>
<p>The problem is that, as Keynes said, markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Either because you really were wrong in your assessment of value, or because your broker is about to close out all your positions, you may have no options left.</p>
<p>There is no way out of this difficult position, which means that you must take ever precaution possible to avoid getting into it. Where there is a possibility of a big position taking your portfolio down, you should buy out of the money options to insure yourself. Sure, the premiums will erode your returns, but if you weren't ultra-confident that this was a big money-spinner you wouldn't take on the position in the first place: right?</p>
<p>Great investors like Warren Buffett and Ben Graham will make a big distinction between investing and speculating, alternatively between investing and trading. I am not sure that these investors explicitly defined the difference, but the essential difference concerns time horizons. Investors want to get rich slowly but surely.</p>
<p>I take the view that the exchanges and techniques used by traders can be used to improve investment returns. Sure, spreads only hurt you when you buy and when you sell, so if you have a 'buy and hold forever' strategy, they don't hurt you much.</p>
<p>However for most people it makes sense to get cheap funding to establish a long-term position early in their trading career when their financial capital is at a minimum, because that way the returns on their investment have the longest time to compound.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#valuation-1" id="valuation-1">Valuation</a></h1>
<p>this is hard</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-to-value-stuff" id="how-to-value-stuff">How to value stuff</a></h2>
<p>Making money by trading is a piece of cake: buy undervalued securities and sell overvalued ones. This reduces all trading to an exercise in valuation. There is a flaw however: this is a sure-fire way to get rich only over an extremely long time frame. As Keynes memorably put it: &quot;The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.&quot; In other words, you have not only to spot mis-valued securities, but also have some confidence that the marginal buyer and seller are going to come around to your way of thinking in a bearable timescale.</p>
<p>In this chapter I will present a number of approaches to valuation that I have found useful. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to identify mis-valued securities. The market is a crowd, and as Francis Galton spotted, a long time a go, under some reasonable constraints, crowds are remarkably good at estimating things like the correct value of a security. &lt;&lt;#surowiecki, Surowiecki&gt;&gt; has a lot to say about this.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#valuation-2" id="valuation-2">Valuation</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#academic-approach" id="academic-approach">Academic approach</a></h3>
<p>The simplest securities to value are those which are risk free. This simply requires one to know the right discount factor. These discount factors can be inferred from the prices of securities which have risk free cash flows.</p>
<p>In practice the securities used are notes and bonds issued by the government, sometimes enhanced with swaps and futures prices (to extend out the curve to long maturities). Of course, there is some risk associated with these securities, but for practical purposes this is not a problem for valuing a security now, in terms of the prices of securities also trading now. The problem comes when one wants to know what the price of a security will be tomorrow, when the the securities it will be priced off have all changed their prices too.</p>
<p>When trading government bonds with a time horizon measured in years, it is critical to know the likely changes in the yield curve. This can come from changes to government or central bank policy, as well as usual factors of supply and demand.</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, if the market has underestimated the extent to which the yield curve will move up then you should be short, and vice versa.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#asset-classes" id="asset-classes">Asset Classes</a></h2>
<p>A lot of rubbish is written about asset classes. The general idea is to increase diversification. Bond prices are driven by interest rates, equity prices by various factors, such as the partition of company income amongst the various factors of production, real economic growth, and many factors specific to certain sectors, or indeed companies. Because the drivers of price across these two asset classes (bonds are different) is is a reasonable expectation that price moves in the two classes will be uncorrelated and hence a portfolio composed of a mixture of the two will have a lower mean variance.</p>
<p>To my mind the most important asset classes are:</p>
<p>. equities, . fixed income, . foreign exchange, and . commodities.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#equities-2" id="equities-2">Equities</a></h3>
<p>The limited liability company was a wonderful invention. The existence of shares arises from a set of contractual relationships between principal and agent. The principal is the provider of capital, the agent is the board.<br />
Equity is simply the last security in the queue for receiving the cash from sales made by the company, so it is odd, in some sense, to treat it as a completely separate class. Some securities, preferred shares, have some characteristics of bond, and some of a share. Even corporate bonds, which are, as their name implies, a bond, are, compared to government bonds, equity like. For this reason they are sometimes considered a separate asset class. Clearly, the boundaries between the various classes are somewhat blurred and arbitrary.</p>
<p>The key thing about equities is that they are the most risky of securities issued by any particular company. They pay a dividend only if there are surplus retained earnings. Even if there are retained earnings, a dividend may not be paid: an investor who purchased a Berkshire Hathaway share fifty years ago is still waiting to receive his first dividend cheque. He is not too worried though: the retained earnings are largely reflected in the price of his security, so if he needs the cash he can sell his share, or use it as collateral for a loan. This is why valuation of shares generally focusses more on earnings: the surplus of income over costs, than dividends: cash paid to shareholders.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#valuation-comparables" id="valuation-comparables">Valuation Comparables</a></h4>
<p><strong>Market Cap to GDP</strong></p>
<p>The natural question to ask about whether a market is overpriced is 'compared to what?'. A lot of valuation metrics arise from various plausible answers to this question. One answer is ''compared to the economy as a whole''. This is, supposedly, a favourite metric of Warren Buffett. It certainly has the advantage of simplicity. The downside is that it does not look at the shift in companies’ preferred financing strategies. Over time, and between countries, companies finance their capital spending in different ways. Investors’ enthusiasm for equities has resulted in substitution of equity for debt. This certainly happened in the 60’s, and is, arguably, happening now. In continental Europe, even large companies choose bank debt over securities and especially over equity, which is regarded as ''Anglo Saxon capitalism''.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Market-Cap-to-GDP.php%5BThis">http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Market-Cap-to-GDP.php[This</a> article] gives some recent figures. Currently this indicator is ''flashing red'' for long positions in equities.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of equities valuation is the noise caused by the business cycle. The well-known Shiller CAPE attempts to do this by looking back over ten years of earnings, to average out some of the noise.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated attempt is <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/guest/Easterling-So-Many-Choices-Part-1.php%5Bthe">http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/guest/Easterling-So-Many-Choices-Part-1.php[the</a> Crestmont P/E]. This produces a less noisy signal, but this is at the cost of bringing in more difficult-to-measure parameters.</p>
<p>In a situation where its impossible to be completely sure that the noise is at an acceptable level, it is best to use as wide a range of indicators, ideally ones which use totally independent statistics.</p>

<h4><a class="header" href="#equities-as-a-call-option" id="equities-as-a-call-option">Equities as a call option</a></h4>
<p>This is the idea that bondholders own the assets of a company until they have been paid off in full. I'm not sure that for practical purposes this helps in day to day investing. It does mean, however, that even a company that has zero, or negative asset value in accounting terms may still have a value as a tradable security. It also explains why share prices can have a very non-linear response to economic variables, e.g. commodity prices.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#small-cap" id="small-cap">Small Cap</a></h4>
<p>Small cap stocks undoubtedly offer many opportunities for the investor who is prepared to do his homework. Large companies often have many analysts poring over their reported results, and market position, but smaller ones can remain unexamined, leaving them, potentially, as hidden gems. However, the downside is that the shares will be less liquid, so that finding a willing seller may be hard, and, they are likely to be more volatile when they do trade.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#large-cap" id="large-cap">Large Cap</a></h4>
<p>Hidden value in larger stocks is less likely, but at least it's easier to buy and sell them. It is also more likely that it will be possible to get an exposure to them via derivatives. In the UK or US, Contracts for Difference may be available.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#bonds" id="bonds">Bonds</a></h4>
<p>A bond is the purest form of exchanging a fixed value of consumption today for a fixed, but larger, amount of consumption in the future. The fixing is in terms of a fixed amount of currency. Generally, for bonds of maturity more than a few months, a coupon is paid, which complicates the calculation of a redemption yield, but for our purposes simply reassures the investor that the issuer is still making money.</p>
<p>A bond is a <em>transferable</em> debt obligation otherwise it would be much more difficult to invest in it. It's easy enough to loan money, but to get an good handle on the risk that the borrower will repay the loan is a different thing entirely. See <em>credit risk</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Issuers</strong></p>
<p>Corporates and governments issue bonds. Because there are so many corporate issues, all with different maturities and coupons, the only truly liquid bonds are ones issued by governments. These are certainly the only ones on which derivatives are issued, and, realistically, the only ones you want to invest in. Government issues are free of credit risk, but nevertheless carry the risk that inflation will destroy the real value of the investment.</p>

<p>Generally, investing in an 'asset' involves going short cash. In reality, there are many currencies, and it is possible to buy and</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#commodities-2" id="commodities-2">Commodities</a></h4>
<p>Commodities have produced spectacular returns for some investors over the last twenty years. There are well-developed and liquid futures markets in many commodities, and in the run up to 2008 commodity prices seemed to be gravity-defying as world demand, particularly from developing markets, outran the ability of miners and farmers to produce the stuff. In a classic cyclical story, the situation now (2015) is the opposite. Prices for commodities seem unable to find a floor as the wave of investment started in the early 2000s continues to produce more than the current demand.</p>
<p>At some point prices will find a floor, production capacity will no longer be able to meet demand, and prices will start their upward march again. Well, this is the simplified story. In practice prices will start to go up, then fall back again, then go up a bit more. In other words, there will be a lot of noise imposed on the orderly development of prices, such that it will be very difficult to discern a clear trend.</p>
<p>Commodity exposure may be obtained via buying physical commodities, via ETFs and ETNs, via derivatives such as options and futures, and via exposure to the securities of mining companies. For example, a bullish view on oil might be expressed via buying shares in Exxon Mobil.</p>
<p>My own preference would be to get exposure to commodities via a suitable index, such as the GSCI. There are liquid futures on this, and it's possible to buy ETFs.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, commodity prices are strongly correlated with inflation. Given that most commodities are priced in US dollars, this really is US price inflation. For an investor based outside the US, it's worth bearing this in mind. If one has a strong directional view on inflation, the alternative to an exposure to commodities is to go long or short government bonds.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#real-estate" id="real-estate">Real Estate</a></h4>
<p>Property produces a stream of income after the initial investment. Although buildings require maintenance and insurance, once they are built they generally are a reliable stream of income, and this income is usually -- depending on the exact terms of the lease -- maintained in real, inflation-adjusted terms.</p>
<p>It is possible to invest in property via securities. Most people are very familiar with the idea of investing in a house, either one to live in, or to rent out. People invest in houses because of familiarity, ease of financing, transparency, and low (or non-existent) management fees, and, in the case of owner-occupation, a absence of tax on the implicit income of living in the property. In the UK there is also very favourable tax treatment of capital gains on disposal of owner occupied property. Moreover, very strict planning laws lead to a highly constricted supply situation. The combination of these factors makes investing in residential property a very popular strategy today.</p>
<p>An alternative to direct exposure to property is purchase of shares in property companies. In recognition of the unequal tax treatment of direct ownership of the asset and ownership via a company, special property companies called REITs have been created, which allow rental income to pass directly to the investor without suffering tax at the company level.</p>
<p>Like commodities, all property investment represents a real asset. Property, because of the pattern of cashflows involved, tends to produce a high and stable cashflow. However, it does not normally offer the possibility of rapid capital appreciation.</p>
<p>My own view is that real estate is highly overrated as a investment, but has a role as part of a balance portfolio. If you feel you need to invest, invest in a REIT, or a REIT ETF. If you need gearing, then use a CFD on such a REIT (e.g. on VNQ). If you really need to get exposure to residential UK property beyond that which you already have if you own your own house, then look at one of the AIM-listed vehicles. There are very few funds which offer this sort of exposure. I am not sure why, but it might be because of the restrictions on pension funds being allowed to invest in residential property.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#readmemd" id="readmemd">README.md</a></h1>
<p>This is my attempt to write a book on investing. It is very far from being finished. I am doing this at least in part to understand gitbook and markdown and git. Currently, I've decided mainly to make a few notes about my trading activity in the hope that in the fullness of time something resembling a coherent strategy will emerge from it retrospectively.</p>
<p>I have had this project on the go for a number of years. I have dialled back my ambition for it and am currently only updating the trading diary section. If you are looking at this book on GitHub you'll see where the recent changes have happened.</p>
<p>If anyone wishes to contribute, especially by doing a bit of editing, I'd love to hear from him. This started out as being compatible with Gitbook, but that project seems to have gone into abeyance. There seems to be someone willing to pick it up, but I don't have enough material yet so I'm not focussing on the production side at all.</p>
<p>I was thinking that it might work as a Jekyll website, but I don't want to think about this yet.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#visitors" id="visitors">Visitors</a></h2>
<p>I see that I'm getting a few visitors to sites hosting my 'book'. I have no idea why this should be. Maybe like so much traffic on the internet these days, these aren't flesh and blood visitors, but just bots. Maybe some day these bots will have enough intelligence to enjoy my musings. Maybe some day after that they'll consider it unbearably simplistic.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-this-book-is-written-in" id="what-this-book-is-written-in">What this book is written in</a></h2>
<p>I have decided to move back towards Markdown and also to re-focus the message of the book so it is more of a toolkit for investing action. I originally used the Gitbook default, which is Markdown, then I moved to Asciidoc, which seemed to offer a bit more, then I went back to Markdown, because, well, it's everywhere, and its supported everywhere. I think I'm probably using 'Git Flavored Markdown', but for this work it probably doesn't make any difference.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-general-idea" id="the-general-idea">The General Idea</a></h2>
<p>This book is to tell you about how to take control of your savings. It is my attempt to record my successes, and failures as a private investor. It is a work in progress. If I have successes, may they inspire you. If I have failures, may some good come of them, as a guide how to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>I do not claim to be a great expert on investing. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been doing this for my own savings for a long time, and I felt that I'd learned some valuable lessons that I should share.</li>
<li>I do do not want your money, unlike many of those who would offer you investment advice.</li>
<li>Software really is eating the world, and nowhere more than in the finance industry. Tools that could be afforded only by traders in the biggest banks can now be used at no or nominal cost by private investors. There are even fewer reasons now to use a professional asset manager than there ever were in the past.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book will turn you into the next George Soros or John Paulson. It will not equip you to be convince anyone to fund your new hedge fund startup. However, it should allow you to manage your own investments with confidence. Your performance should be good enough to outperform the majority of fund managers. You will need to factor the extra time you spend researching, but you can offset this against your brokerage fees.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#carry-cost" id="carry-cost">carry cost</a></h2>
<p>To understand the net return on a portfolio it is best to imagine<br />
creating it ex nihilo. To acquire assets it is then necessary to borrow,<br />
typically by borrowing (shorting) your home currency, or some other<br />
funding source. Although people do not always think about equity<br />
porfolios this way, it is actually a useful way to think about whether<br />
or not an investment really is worth making. It might sound good to hold<br />
a share portfolio for a year and show a total return of 10%, but if<br />
short term interest rates are running at 12% it suddenly doesn’t sound<br />
so smart any more.<br />
Because the Yen was, for so long, the currency with the cheapest carry<br />
cost, it became very common, and profitable, to put on a '<code>Yen carry     trade</code>', which involves selling the Yen against (for example) the dollar.<br />
Because the long asset has the higher yield, this was a profitable<br />
trade. Clearly the danger is that the Yen goes up before the redemption<br />
date. This is exactly what simple arbitrage considerations would leave<br />
us to believe.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#execution-only" id="execution-only">Execution Only</a></h2>
<p>This, in the context of brokers, means an account where no advice is given. Traditionally, brokers would undertake research to give their clients ideas about how to trade. With so much excellent analysis available on the Internet for free, this is, increasingly,<br />
an outdated model. Even if a brokerage produces excellent research, of a standard which gives it monetary value, it is unlikely that the same brokerage would be the best for pure execution. Historically, broker commissions were fixed, so they competed on the quality of their research and other service. This, in the UK, came to an abrupt halt in 1986, the year of the 'Big Bang'.</p>

<p>VRX:: Valeant. Stock and CFD. Pharma stock. Subject to a big battle involving Pershing Capital, run by Bill Ackman. Considered to be playing fast and loose with sales methods.</p>
<p>SPX :: The S&amp;P 500 Index accounts for approximately 40% of total global stockmarket capitalization. It is by far the most important stock market index in the world. Exposure can be obtained by trading SP futures, or by ES futures. The latter is one fifth the size of the former (the so-called 'mini' future, which is worth 50 times the value of the index). +</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If one security must be picked to represent 'the stockmarket' this is it.  Note that this contains some Canadian stocks. +</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of CFDs that offer an exposure to this index. The most liquid is SPY, but others may offer the same exposure with lower charges, such as VTI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>EIS:: The STOXX 600 insurance sector index future. There are tickers for all sectors within the STOXX 600, but this is one I have recently been trading. It is reasonably liquid, but of course does not have the liquidity of the ESTX50.</p>
<p>EAFE:: 'Europe, Australasia and the Far East'. The MSCI index for developed markets outside of North America.</p>
<p>MXEA:: is the ICE future which tracks this index. Basically this is the 'Rest of the World' as far as the US is concerned. A 60:40 mix of SPX and EAFE will give you a market cap weighted exposure to global stockmarkets with just two securities. + + The linked CFD is EFA.</p>
<p>NQ:: The Nasdaq index future. One hundred, mainly high-tech stocks. Several CFDs, notably QQQ.</p>
<p>RDXUSD:: Russian ADR index. There is a Micex future, but it is much less easily traded, at least for westerners.</p>
<p>TOPX:: The Tokyo TOPIX index future.</p>
<p>XINA50:: China 50 index, traded at SGX. Long trading hours through UK day.</p>
<p>ESTX50:: STOXX 50 index. Good liquidity in futures, options, and futures options.</p>
<p>STX50:: Dollar-denominated version of ESTX50.</p>
<p>DJ600:: Full 600 constituent index. Futures contract, but no options.</p>
