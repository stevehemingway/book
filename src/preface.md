# Preface

I started writing this in 2016. I spent a lot of time looking for the perfect software to write it in. I tend to indulge in displacement activities. At least I have now settled on [gitbook](https://gitbook.com) and so I can work on the content.

My main activity at the moment is giving a semi-running commentary on my investing. I am not sure that this will make very interesting reading, but it at least gives me some kind of narrative which I can use for investing.

I want to avoid this being just a book listing every possible type of security. Hopefully, I the various options will arise naturally as I explain my various trading ideas.

## For the technically minded

The files for this book are kept as git repositories on gitbook, github and bitbucket. You can fork my source from the first two. I will probably delete from one fairly soon. Gitbook is a git server, so the easiest way to edit offline is to edit, git add, git commit and git push to gitbook. There are lots of links to gitbook attached to this book. Follow them if you are interested.

I started using markdown, then went to asciidoc. Unfortunately, asciidoc is just not as well supported, so I reverted to markdown, which wasted a bit of time. Markdown is pretty basic, but it's fairly intuitive, and lots of platforms and tools use it. Many editors have syntax colouring for it. I strongly recommend Typora as a markdown editor. It does a lot more than simply allow one to create stuff in markdown and covert it to HTML.

I've used latex format for the odd equation, and embedded them with katex. This is black magic to me, but it seems to work. The maths is not important. I just put it in to keep the nerds happy.
