# Overview

## Current state of play

Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it's trend will not be reversed. The "Incredible Hulks" trade should survive, but DJP has badly injured it.

US Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be vulnerable.

The big risk is that QE infinity will lift all boats. I am not sure what to do about this. Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks. But if bond issuers can raise capital at \(likely\) negative rates, won't that support their share prices?

The biggest beneficiary of QE inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I'll make money. As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don't have a clue about what will happen.

Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like MBS ETFs and companies suspected of fraud. Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does. Obviously, your shorting of TSLA, which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even lately.

## Insurance

Insurance companies rely on returns on their float to cover the cost of their claims. Deaths will be up a bit \(maybe overall down though, because of less pollution and less general infection\). Negative risk-free yields and defaults on corporate debt will increase liabilities, and reduce assets: not a good combo. The other problem is companies who liabilities which are defined benefit pensions. This will mainly be municipals, but also some paternalistic employers.

## When Markets are due for a correction

No matter how over valued or insane valuations are, even that arbitrage opportunities exist, it's still foolish to trade on the basis that the market will suddenly wake up to your view before drifting a long way further along the path that it had previously been on.

Markets are self-fulfilling prophesies.

## Perma Bear or Perma Bull?

[This](https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/04/12/what-the-perma-bulls-and-perma-bears-get-wrong/) is a fantastically balanced piece by Value Stock Geek. He says that:

* being ideological is a barrier to being a successful investor,
* the Fed is not the author of all our misfortune, nor is it the omnipotent wizard that can stop all recessions,
* the markets are not as rational as Eugene Fama would like them to be but they are also not as irrational as the ideologues think,
* that, actually, it is best to avoid overreacting to any market moves.

There are some good links to videos from Peter Lynch and Milton Friedman. There is quite a good link to an old Onion piece making fun of the money illusion.

## The worst stocks will likely have the biggest recoveries

This is a very important principle. Often, a big turnover company with poor margins will be pushed into loss by a bad economy. When the economy bounces back, even a bit, the eps can roar back \(even though earnings yield is still pretty crap\). You also have a momentum thing, and a liquidity thing. Basically, something illiquid and high beta should not be shorted, no matter how much a basket case it seems. Except in tiny size.

## Gold nervousness

Sold a few MU. Noticed that GC was damaging my bottom line and decided to reduce my exposure by writing some calls. It's complicated because I have a stop at the strike price. Prob. better cancel the stop.
