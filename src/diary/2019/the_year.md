# Twenty nineteen â€” a year to forget

This was a disasterous year. After the Christmas Eve massacre the markets, particularly the equities markets, rallied all year.

This was a valuable, but fantastically expensive, lesson in why you have to be patient and you can make money by shorting in a bull market.
