## Books on Investing

* [Mastering the Market Cycle](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Market-Cycle-Getting-Odds/dp/1328479250) by Howard Marks. Very insightful book on how markets exhibit cyclicality, irrationality and, most importantly, how to profit from it. Very good discussion of risk.
* [Mr Market Miscalculates](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mr-Market-Miscalculates-James-Grant/dp/1604190086/). Good selection of articles from _Grant's Interest Rate Observer_ mainly about the madness of markets.
* [brealey-and-myers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Principles-Corporate-Finance-Richard-Brealey/dp/1259009513), _Principles of Corporate Finance_. If you want to understand what a company is, and how it raises finance, this is the book to read.
* Elton, _Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis_. Goes through the theory at length. Written before ETFs took over everything.
* [Global Asset Allocation, Mel Faber](http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9780988679924) . Book about how to construct an 'all weather' portfolio - i.e. one that will continue to deliver positive returns in all market conditions. Backtesting of a number of recommended strategies.
* [Ilmanen, _Expected Returns: An Investor's Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Expected-Returns-Investors-Harvesting-Rewards/dp/1119990726).
* [Kroijer, _Investing Demystified: How to Invest Without Speculation and Sleepless Nights_, Hans Kroijer.](http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9780273781349).
* [The Hedge Fund Mirage](http://www.sl-advisors.com/the-hedge-fund-mirage/) Essential reading if you are ever seized with the desire to hand over your hard-earned savings to a hedge fund manager. Unfortunately, for many savers, including badly-paid public sector employees, they have no choice, because their pension savings are entrusted, in part, to these modern-day racketeers.
* John Hull, _Options, Futures and Other Derivatives_. Dated, but a good introductory book on plain vanilla derivatives.
* [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393330338). Originally published in 1973, the popular book that revealed that a chimp with a dartboard had a very good chance of outperforming the best fund managers.
* [The Wisdom of Crowds: _Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies and Nations_, ISBN 9780385721707, , James Surowiecki](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439233968&sr=8-1&keywords=9780385721707).
* [The Dao of Capital: Austrian Investing in a Distorted World, Spitznagel](http://www.amazon.com/The-Dao-Capital-Investing-Distorted/dp/111834703X%20). Austrians believe in strong property rights, strong enforcement of those rights, and minimal government action beyond what is needed to make the market function. This book is not a practical manual, and rather talks about the world as the author would like it to be, rather than how it is. One for the gold bugs.
* [Debt and Delusion](http://www.amazon.com/Debt-Delusion-Threaten-Economic-Disaster/dp/0977079333) \(or ''Central Bank Follies that Threaten Economic Disaster'' \). This is an extraordinary book that got dismissive reviews when it was published, hardly sold at all, but then was hailed as uncannily prescient then the economic disaster that did strike in 2008 finally hit.
* \[Security Analysis\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security\_Analysis\_\(book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Analysis_%28book)\)\), Graham and Dodd. Classic text on value investing.

### Internet Resources

* [Fleckenstein Capital](http://fleckensteincapital.com/). Bill Fleckenstein makes all his material that is more than one year old available to all. He is very good on the folly of central banks but is very focussed on how an understanding of what they are doing wrong can be used to your financial advantage. Bill has a lot of real world experience of making money in bear markets.
* [The Money Illusion](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/). Scott Sumner, champion of Nominal Gross Domestic Product Level Targeting. Scott explains why Central Banks misunderstand how tight monetary conditions are and how this leads to sub-optimal economic growth.
* [Zero Hedge](http://zerohedge.com). The BuzzFeed of financial news websites.
* [Seeking Alpha](http://seekingalpha.com) Huge website largely aimed at spotting mispriced shares, but with articles on wider topics too, including good coverage of ETFs.
* [The Bogle Heads Forum](https://www.bogleheads.org/). All about the importance of fees as a determinant of successful investing.
* [D Short on Advisor Perspectives](http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/). Articles on investment strategy sponsored by D Short. Aimed at advisors but free and though provoking. Lots of good stuff about long-term valuation metrics such as Tobin's Q and the Crestmont PE ratio \(a cyclically-adjusted PE ratio similar to the CAPE ratio\).
* [Dividend Disco](http://seekingalpha.com/author/dividend-disco). A funny, jokey, honest look at one man's search for yield in what has become a desert for those seeking income. On Seeking Alpha.
* [General regular reports from JPM Asset Management](http://insights.jpmorgan.co.uk/adviser/commentary-and-analysis/jpmorgan-market-views/). This is a serious 'grown up' view of the market out look, from a highly respected firm. It is free, although it is possible that you get more, or more immediate, access if you are an actual client.
* [Goldman Sachs Research](http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking). Another bulge-bracket player offering some of their research for free. These firms want to have a web presence, and know that their clients expect it. They maybe don't share all their latest thoughts on the website, but long-term trends have to be discussed, and will be accessible. If you as an investor have a long-term focus, that is all you really need.
* [Star Capital Advisors](http://www.starcapital.de/). This firms website has an interactive search facility which shows global markets and sectors ranked by various valuation metrics: price-to-book, price-to-sales etc. The page is fully interactive. The focus is on CAPE, but markets can be ranked by any of the measures. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this data, but if it is accurate, it is all collected together in a very convenient format.
* [Sentiment Trader](https://www.sentimentrader.com/): paid for service with free taster email. Not just mindless "head and shoulders pattern" chartist analysis, but an aggregation of lots of sentiment-related data.
* [The Daily Shot](https://dailyshotbrief.com/): daily update of market-related stats. If you are a subscriber to the WSJ you can get the full version; the 'brief' version, linked to here, is free but limited. Lots of this data is available for free from other places, but it's handy to have it delivered.
