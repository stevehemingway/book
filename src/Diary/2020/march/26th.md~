Still reeling from the huge rally on Tuesday. Initial unemployment claims hit *3.3 million* and the SPX goes up by 4%.
This is truly an incomprehensible market.

Trades (new format: brackets after ticker indicate 

- O: opening trade, 
- P: trade closed at a profit, 
- L: trade closed at a loss, 
- E: trade closed pretty much flat.
