# 21 April 2020

### What's happening?

All the press is discussing the fact that the settlment price for April WTI was negative $37! Seems amazing, but of course when there is no storage, you may have to pay for the privilege of delivering to someone.

As always, a green print on your portfolio value always emboldens you to trade. This mornings trades were:

* trimmed back GC, still a bit long gold.
* sold an ES call. Still a bit long, but equity indexes falling back,
* bought NG, couple of lots
* sold CL, one lot, to get exposure to the crude/gas spread. 
* sold WEIR -- an overhyped and expensive stock highly exposed to the fracking business.
* bought some European EURN, bought some FRO \(put in an order\). These trades seem to come with -ve impact on margin -- why?
* Sold a very long-dated ESTX50 call. I have been burned too much on negative theta positions, and I like to earn a bit of premium while I wait for markets to break.

Oh, yes. I rolled over an NG future because delivering was looming up.


## Wrap

Ok, closed a lot of expensive hedges. 
Closed some short puts on TSLA which I'd used to hedge short.
Closed ES and NQ, as they plummeted. It's a risk-off day today.
Bought an OOM long-dated QQQ put. Very small size. Just because ... gut.
Set up a trailing buy for ES, in case (when) there is a rally.
Closed ESTX50 long fut.
Closed short ROKU call.
Closed some short BA puts at a loss, to get out of the hedged posn.
In spite of realizing $X of losses, just about made it up on the unrealized mtm.
