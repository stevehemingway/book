OK, I've kinda gone delta-neutral on my long long-dated puts on TSLA, RUT and BA with shorter-dated short puts.
This was a smart move. 
The market has been rocketing lately, for no obvious reason, as usual.
At least I haven't been damaged too badly.

My big mistake was going long three contracts June GC.
Gold, although it's doing well, was smashed.
A hedging position, short puts, offset some of the damage, but it still accounts for my downside.

My "incredible hulks" strategy seems not to be holed below the waterline, yet. Nothing spectacular though, 
as oil has been rallying, with incessant boosterism from the orange buffoon
(who is, naturally, enjoying record approval ratings).

Anyway, I bought one ESTX50, because "if you can't beat them, join them".

I sold one ZAR (ZAR, TRL, and other weak currencies are going to get smashed).

EMB looks a safe short [according to SA](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4338000-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-sow-seeds-of-next-financial-crisis?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=wingcapital-investments-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-could-sow-the-seeds-of-the-next-financial-crisis&utm_campaign=rta-author-article&utm_content=link-0). 
You shorted EMB a while ago, via CFD, but it has done nothing so far.

Oddly enough GILD is rocketing, as there a rumour that Remdesivir, an anti-viral, is effective against Covid-19.

Article by Karen Ward in the FT saying that inflation was breaking higher. 
100% of the comment disagreed, but at some point it really is going to happen.
