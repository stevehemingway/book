## Stops and limits 

OK, overnight, a few stops were triggered, with some modest downside. Your short in DJ600 went again. 
The good thing was that this has dropped your risk level a lot.
Because of the insane volatility, this is a good thing.



## Morning

Closed out: RDXUSD, DJ600, FXI PUTS, MXEA. Mainly stops. Not too bad. Can stand a longer market excursion.

You tend to close out your winners too soon: you are looking sick on BA puts & RUT puts (although after a good day yesterday). 

Best performance is FXI. You closed out quite a chunk of this overnight.

You bought some GC via stop. 


## Afternoon

BX closed at slight profit.

ESTX50 closed at loss (rising market)

Bought more EURN cfds and one NAV put.

Opened a posn. in CACC. Decided that the crash is going to flush out some of the naked swimmers.


random extra line.
