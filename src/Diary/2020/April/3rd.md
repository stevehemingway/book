# Friday 3rd April 2020

## Morning 

- Sold to open: AAPL, Z, DJ600, RR. Bearish. AAPL was yesterday, but late.
- Closed: SX7P fut. No longer hedging very modest put posn.

Summary: transferred £200k to mortgage, so now maint. margin is ~50% of equity, so quite high risk. Stops on everything.
Biggest posns. still TSLA and RUT. TSLA is high risk: deliveries announced yesterday. 
No great pop, but Musk still appearing to show good production and sales. 

Asked a question of Bill Fleckenstein about which bonds are best to short in the time of Covid-induced inflation. 
We'll see if he answers.
