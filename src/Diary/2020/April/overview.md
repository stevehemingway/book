# Overview

## Current state of play

Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. 
Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it's trend will not be reversed.
The "Incredible Hulks" trade should survive, but DJP has badly injured it. 

US Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. 
Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be vulnerable.

The big risk is that QE infinity will  lift all boats. 
I am not sure what to do about this. 
Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks.
But if bond issuers can raise capital at (likely) negative rates, won't that support their share prices?

The biggest beneficiary of QE inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I'll make money. 
As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don't have a clue about what will happen.

Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like MBS ETFs and companies suspected of fraud.
Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does.
Obviously, your shorting of TSLA, which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even lately.
