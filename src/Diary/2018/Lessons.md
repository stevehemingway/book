# 2018 and lessons I learned

2018 was a brutal year for me. I've been trading for many decades, with moderate success. 
I feel that I had got to the point that understood a lot about macro and how it interacted with markets. 
Unfortunately, there is a big difference between investing and trading, and I failed to understand this.
Trading requires the following:

- never leave an open position without a stop-loss order 

- do not assume that recent (low) volatility is any guide to future (high) volatility. 
The underpinning idea that securities have a forward price probability distribution which is approximately constant is false.

- by all means have your convictions, but if the market moves against you, find some others! 
However correct your analysis, in the short term you can lose a lot of money, and the short term can continue for a very long time.

- treat all positions as having the potential to kill you. 
Familiarity breeds complacency and unintended excess gearing.

- do not assume that your broker's calculation of how much margin you have to post is a good measure of your risk.

- remember that markets take the stairs up and the elevator (with a frayed cable) down.
