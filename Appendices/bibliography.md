-	 http://www.sl-advisors.com/the-hedge-fund-mirage/[The Hedge Fund Mirage] Essential reading if you are ever seized with the desire to hand over your hard-earned savings to a hedge fund manager. Unfortunately, for many savers, including badly-paid public sector employees, they have no choice, because their pension savings are entrusted, in part, to these modern-day racketeers.

### Internet Resources
-	 http://www.themoneyillusion.com/[The Money Illusion].

-	 http://zerohedge.com[Zero Hedge] the antidote to the market cheerleaders employed by the banks on the sell side, and basically the whole of Wall Street.

-	 http://seekingalpha.com[The Seeking Alpha] Huge website largely aimed at spotting mispriced shares, but with articles on wider topics too, including good coverage of ETFs.

-    https://www.bogleheads.org/[The Bogle Heads Forum] All about the importance of fees as a determinant of successful investing.

-	 http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/[D Short on Advisor Perspectives] Articles on investment strategy sponsored by D Short. Aimed at advisors but free and though provoking. Lots of good stuff about long-term valuation metrics such as Tobin's Q and the Crestmont PE ratio (a cyclically-adjusted PE ratio similar to the CAPE ratio).

-	 http://seekingalpha.com/author/dividend-disco[Seeking Alpha author Dividend Disco]. A funny, jokey, honest look at one man's search for yield in what has become a desert for those seeking income.

-	 http://insights.jpmorgan.co.uk/adviser/commentary-and-analysis/jpmorgan-market-views/[General regular reports from JPM Asset Management]. This is a serious 'grown up' view of the market out look, from a highly respected firm. It is free, although it is possible that you get more, or more immediate, access if you are an actual client. 

-    http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking[Goldman Sachs Research]. Another bulge-bracket player offering some of their research for free. These firms want to have a web presence, and know that their clients expect it. They maybe don't share all their latest thoughts on the website, but long-term trends have to be discussed, and will be accessible. If you as an investor have a long-term focus, that is all you really need.

-    http://www.starcapital.de/[Star Capital Advisors]. This firms website has an interactive search facility which shows global markets and sectors ranked by various valuation metrics: price-to-book, price-to-sales etc. The page is fully interactive. The focus is on CAPE, but markets can be ranked by any of the measures. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this data, but if it is accurate, it is all collected together in a very convenient format.

-    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Analysis_(book)[Security Analysis], Graham and Dodd. The book from which Warren Buffett learned his trade.
